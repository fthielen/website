  abstract = {Background Venetoclax plus obinutuzumab has been established as a fixed-duration treatment regimen for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We compared the long-term efficacy after treatment cessation of the combination of venetoclax plus obinutuzumab with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods CLL14 is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 196 sites in 21 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and coexisting conditions with a cumulative illness rating scale greater than 6, a creatinine clearance of 30\textendash 69 mL/min, or both. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a web and voicemail system with allocation concealment and based on a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of six and stratified by Binet stage and geographical region. Patients received either venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (oral venetoclax initiated on day 22 of cycle 1 [28-day cycles], with a 5-week dose ramp-up [20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, then 400 mg daily for 1 week], thereafter continuing at 400 mg daily until completion of cycle 12; combined with intravenous obinutuzumab for six cycles starting with 100 mg on day 1 and 900 mg on day 2 [or 1000 mg on day 1], 1000 mg on days 8 and day 15 of cycle 1, and subsequently 1000 mg on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6) or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (oral chlorambucil at 0{$\cdot$}5 mg/kg bodyweight on days 1 and 15 of each cycle for 12 cycles combined with the same obinutuzumab regimen). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patient enrolment is complete, and the study is registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT02242942. Findings Between Aug 7, 2015, and Aug 4, 2016, 432 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (n=216) or chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (n=216). All patients had been off treatment for at least 24 months at data collection. At a median follow-up of 39{$\cdot$}6 months (IQR 36{$\cdot$}8\textendash 43{$\cdot$}0), patients given venetoclax plus obinutuzumab had a significantly longer progression-free survival than did patients given chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (HR 0{$\cdot$}31, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}22\textendash 0{$\cdot$}44; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Median progression-free survival was not reached (95\% CI not estimable to not estimable) in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group vs 35{$\cdot$}6 months (33{$\cdot$}7\textendash 40{$\cdot$}7) in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event in both groups was neutropenia (112 [53\%] of 212 patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group versus 102 [48\%] of 214 patients in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group). Serious adverse events occurred in 115 (54\%) of 212 patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group and 95 (44\%) of 214 patients in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group. Venetoclax or chlorambucil treatment-related deaths were reported in one (1\%) of 212 patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group (n=1 sepsis) and two (1\%) of 214 patients in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group (n=1 septic shock, n=1 metastatic skin squamous carcinoma). Interpretation 2 years after treatment cessation, venetoclax plus obinutuzumab continues to significantly improve progression-survival compared with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, thereby providing a limited duration treatment option for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the incidence and predictive factors for development of transformed lymphoma in a population-based series of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Lymphoid Cancer Database was used to identify patients with FL diagnosed and treated in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Transformed lymphoma was defined as the development of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients with FL. Factors present at the time of initial diagnosis of indolent NHL and at transformation were analyzed for their impact on risk of transformation and subsequent outcome. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2001, 600 patients with newly diagnosed FL met the inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 109 months (range, 10 to 244), 170 (28\%) developed transformation, 107 (63\%) based on biopsy confirmation. The annual risk of transformation was 3\% continuously through 15 years. A multivariate analysis of clinical factors at diagnosis identified advanced stage as the only predictor of future transformation. The median post-transformation survival was 1.7 years. The 5-year survival was superior for patients with limited extent transformation compared with those with advanced cases (66\% v 19\%, P {$<$} .0001). Patients with transformation based on clinical versus histological criteria had an identical median survival of 1.8 years (P = .2). CONCLUSION: The annual risk of transformation of FL is 3\% continuing without plateau beyond 15 years. Advanced stage at diagnosis is predictive of future transformation. Clinically diagnosed transformation has an equal impact on outcome as biopsy proven transformation.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews of studies of effectiveness are the centrepiece of evidence-based medicine and policy making. Increasingly, systematic reviews of economic evaluations are also an expected input into much evidence-based policy making, with some health economists even calling for 'an economics approach to systematic review'. This paper questions the value of conducting systematic reviews of economic evaluations to inform decision making in health care. It argues that the value of systematic reviews of economic evaluations is usually undermined by three things. Firstly, compared with effectiveness studies, there is a much wider range of factors that limit the generalisability of cost-effectiveness results, over time and between health systems and service settings, including the context-dependency of resource use and opportunity costs, and different decision contexts and budget constraints. Secondly, because economic evaluations are more explicitly intended to be decision-informing, the requirements for generalisability take primacy, and considerations of internal validity become more secondary. Thirdly, since one of the two main forms of economic evaluation - decision analytic modelling - is itself a well-developed method of evidence synthesis, in most cases the need for a comprehensive systematic review of previous economic evaluations of a particular health technology or policy choice is unwarranted. I conclude that apparent 'meta-analytic expectations' for clear and widely applicable cost-effectiveness conclusions from systematic reviews of economic evaluations are optimistic and generally futile. For more useful insights and knowledge from previous economic studies in evidence-based policy making, a more limited range of reasons for conducting systematic reviews of health economic studies is proposed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine how we define good practice in sensitivity analysis in general and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) in particular, and to what extent it has been adhered to in the independent economic evaluations undertaken for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) over recent years; to establish what policy impact sensitivity analysis has in the context of NICE, and policy-makers' views on sensitivity analysis and uncertainty, and what use is made of sensitivity analysis in policy decision-making. DATA SOURCES: Three major electronic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, were searched from inception to February 2008. REVIEW METHODS: The meaning of 'good practice' in the broad area of sensitivity analysis was explored through a review of the literature. An audit was undertaken of the 15 most recent NICE multiple technology appraisal judgements and their related reports to assess how sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by independent academic teams for NICE. A review of the policy and guidance documents issued by NICE aimed to assess the policy impact of the sensitivity analysis and the PSA in particular. Qualitative interview data from NICE Technology Appraisal Committee members, collected as part of an earlier study, were also analysed to assess the value attached to the sensitivity analysis components of the economic analyses conducted for NICE. RESULTS: All forms of sensitivity analysis, notably both deterministic and probabilistic approaches, have their supporters and their detractors. Practice in relation to univariate sensitivity analysis is highly variable, with considerable lack of clarity in relation to the methods used and the basis of the ranges employed. In relation to PSA, there is a high level of variability in the form of distribution used for similar parameters, and the justification for such choices is rarely given. Virtually all analyses failed to consider correlations within the PSA, and this is an area of concern. Uncertainty is considered explicitly in the process of arriving at a decision by the NICE Technology Appraisal Committee, and a correlation between high levels of uncertainty and negative decisions was indicated. The findings suggest considerable value in deterministic sensitivity analysis. Such analyses serve to highlight which model parameters are critical to driving a decision. Strong support was expressed for PSA, principally because it provides an indication of the parameter uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The review and the policy impact assessment focused exclusively on documentary evidence, excluding other sources that might have revealed further insights on this issue. In seeking to address parameter uncertainty, both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses should be used. It is evident that some cost-effectiveness work, especially around the sensitivity analysis components, represents a challenge in making it accessible to those making decisions. This speaks to the training agenda for those sitting on such decision-making bodies, and to the importance of clear presentation of analyses by the academic community.},

EUROCARE\textemdash the largest cooperative study of population-based cancer survival in Europe\textemdash has shown persistent differences between countries for cancer survival, although in general, cancer survival is improving. Major changes in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation occurred in the early 2000s.

Uniform quality control procedures were applied to all datasets. For patients diagnosed 2000\textendash 07, we calculated 5-year relative survival for 46 cancers weighted by age and country. We also calculated country-specific and age-specific survival for ten common cancers, together with survival differences between time periods (for 1999\textendash 2001, 2002\textendash 04, and 2005\textendash 07).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}5-year relative survival generally increased steadily over time for all European regions. The largest increases from 1999\textendash 2001 to 2005\textendash 07 were for prostate cancer (73{$\cdot$}4\% [95\% CI 72{$\cdot$}9\textendash 73{$\cdot$}9] \emph{vs} 81{$\cdot$}7\% [81{$\cdot$}3\textendash 82{$\cdot$}1]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (53{$\cdot$}8\% [53{$\cdot$}3\textendash 54{$\cdot$}4] \emph{vs} 60{$\cdot$}4\% [60{$\cdot$}0\textendash 60{$\cdot$}9]), and rectal cancer (52{$\cdot$}1\% [51{$\cdot$}6\textendash 52{$\cdot$}6] \emph{vs} 57{$\cdot$}6\% [57{$\cdot$}1\textendash 58{$\cdot$}1]). Survival in eastern Europe was generally low and below the European mean, particularly for cancers with good or intermediate prognosis. Survival was highest for northern, central, and southern Europe. Survival in the UK and Ireland was intermediate for rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but low for kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers. Survival for lung cancer in the UK and Ireland was much lower than for other regions for all periods, although results for lung cancer in some regions (central and eastern Europe) might be affected by overestimation. Survival usually decreased with age, although to different degrees depending on region and cancer type.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The major advances in cancer management that occurred up to 2007 seem to have resulted in improved survival in Europe. Likely explanations of differences in survival between countries include: differences in stage at diagnosis and accessibility to good care, different diagnostic intensity and screening approaches, and differences in cancer biology. Variations in socioeconomic, lifestyle, and general health between populations might also have a role. Further studies are needed to fully interpret these findings and how to remedy disparities.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Italian Ministry of Health, European Commission, Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation, Cariplo Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Previously, we have developed the iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) algorithm for use in classification. Here, we extend the iterative BMA algorithm for application to survival analysis on high-dimensional microarray data. The main goal in applying survival analysis to microarray data is to determine a highly predictive model of patients' time to event (such as death, relapse, or metastasis) using a small number of selected genes. Our multivariate procedure combines the effectiveness of multiple contending models by calculating the weighted average of their posterior probability distributions. Our results demonstrate that our iterative BMA algorithm for survival analysis achieves high prediction accuracy while consistently selecting a small and cost-effective number of predictor genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment for patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or transformed indolent lymphoma (TIL). The treatment is mainly considered for younger patients still available for the work market. In this study, social outcomes after ASCT in terms of return to work (RTW) are described. PATIENTS AND METHODS Information from national administrative registers was combined with clinical information on patients, who received ASCT for relapse of DLBCL or TIL between 2000 and 2012. A total of 164 patients were followed until RTW, disability or old-age pension, death, or December 31, 2015, whichever came first. A total of 205 patients were followed with disability pension as the event of interest. Cox models were used to determine cause-specific hazards. RESULTS During follow-up, 82 (50\%) patients returned to work. The rate of returning to work in the first year following ASCT was decreased for patients being on sick leave at the time of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3 [0.2;0.5]) and increased for patients aged {$\geq$}55 years (HR 1.9 [1.1;3.3]). In all, 56 (27\%) patients were granted disability pension. Being on sick leave at the time of relapse was positively associated with receiving a disability pension in the first 2 years after ASCT (HR 3.7 [1.8;7.7]). CONCLUSION Patients on sick leave at the time of relapse have a poorer prognosis regarding RTW and have a higher rate of disability pension. Furthermore, patients {$>$}55 are more likely to RTW compared to younger patients. These results indicate an unmet need for focused social rehabilitation.},

HCU of alloHCT was determined over 3 time periods: pre-alloHCT, during alloHCT (day 0 to day~+365), and post-alloHCT. The median total cost per patient during the alloHCT year was \$413,000 inpatient and \$18,000 outpatient. Post-alloHCT HCU decreased when compared with pre-alloHCT and control subjects. The median cost of post-alloHCT outpatient visits per patient was significantly less when compared with pre-alloHCT (P~=~.044). The median cost of post-alloHCT inpatient visits per patient approached significance when compared with those pre-alloHCT (P~=~.079). Sixteen post-alloHCT patients, 19 control subjects, and 14 unaffected siblings were surveyed using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and EuroQOL questionnaires; however, the questionnaire scores across all 3 patient groups were not statistically significant (P~=~.2638). When adjusted for health-related quality of life, the analysis suggested alloHCT has a positive impact on health-related quality of life over control subjects.

  abstract = {Abstract In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data. In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width). There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes). When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect. It also eliminated at least 98\% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates. Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct. When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.

Of 722 randomized patients, 552 had cytogenetic results; 137 (25\%) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and 172 (32\%) had 1q21 amplification alone. PFS was improved with IRd vs placebo-Rd in both high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics subgroups: in high-risk patients, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.543 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.321-0.918; P = .021), with median PFS of 21.4 vs 9.7 months; in standard-risk patients, HR was 0.640 (95\% CI, 0.462-0.888; P = .007), with median PFS of 20.6 vs 15.6 months. This PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups with individual high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including patients with del(17p) (HR, 0.596; 95\% CI, 0.286-1.243). PFS was also longer with IRd vs placebo-Rd in patients with 1q21 amplification (HR, 0.781; 95\% CI, 0.492-1.240), and in the ``expanded high-risk'' group, defined as those with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and/or 1q21 amplification (HR, 0.664; 95\% CI, 0.474-0.928). IRd demonstrated substantial benefit compared with placebo-Rd in relapsed and/or refractory MM (RRMM) patients with high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics, and improves the poor PFS associated with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT01564537.},

This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.},

The author briefly explains the theory behind GEEs and their beneficial statistical properties and limitations and compares GEEs to suboptimal approaches for analyzing longitudinal data through use of two examples. The first demonstration applies GEEs to the analysis of data from a longitudinal lab study with a counted response variable; the second demonstration applies GEEs to analysis of data with a normally distributed response variable from subjects nested within branch offices ofan organization.},

Much attention has been focused on potential biases stemming from the methodological shortcomings of economic evaluation. This article adds to this and concentrates on the `real world' relevance of results from economic evaluation as an additional step towards making results more useful to decision-makers. Being the accepted standard for economic evaluation, the RCT is used as the reference case; yet, many of the issues raised are also relevant for other research designs. Three classes of biases are examined. The first relates to the limited scope that economic analysts sometimes choose in RCTs. The second class involves the methodological aspects of RCTs and questions the `real world' relevance of the tools with which economic analysts estimate costs on the basis of RCTs. The third class concerns the representativeness of RCT results, i.e. the generalizability of these results and their usefulness in other treatment contexts. Options for limiting the potential confounding influences of these biases are discussed. A check-list is provided which should be applied by decision-makers when using results from RCTs in their own decision context and by economic evaluators when constructing and describing RCTs. This will enhance the relevance of the results of economic evaluation in decision-making and improve the information basis for actual allocation decisions in health care.},

  abstract = {Preemptive administration of tocilizumab (toci) to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy may reduce rates of serious CRS but conversely may worsen neurotoxicity or risk of infections. Optimal toci administration strategies for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) receiving B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR-T therapies have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to identify whether shorter time-to-toci intervals (hours between first fever attributed to CRS and first dose of toci) have any impact on therapy-related toxicities or clinical outcomes among patients with RRMM receiving BCMA-directed CAR-T therapies. We retrospectively analyzed our institution's experience with 4 BCMA-directed CAR-T therapies (idecabtagene vicleucel, bb21217, ciltacabtagene autoleucel, and orvacabtagene autoceucel) for RRMM over a 3-year period ending in June 2020. We divided patients based on the administration of toci and median time-to-toci interval into early-toci (time-to-toci {$\leq$}50th percentile), late-toci (time-to-toci {$>$}50th percentile), and no-toci (no toci received) groups. We compared the early-toci and late-toci groups with regard to patient characteristics, weight-based CAR-T toxicities, selected toxicities (CRS, neurotoxicity, macrophage activation syndrome, or infections), and clinical outcomes. Of 50 analyzed patients with a median follow-up of 15.3 months, 76\% (n~=~38) received {$\geq$}1 dose of toci (range, 1 to 3) and were classified into early-toci (time-to-toci {$\leq$}12 hours) or late-toci (time-to-toci {$>$}12 hours) groups. The 2 groups (n~=~19 each) had similar CRS grade distributions, hours to CRS onset, CRS-related biomarkers, and incidences of neurotoxicity or severe infections; however, weight-adjusted CAR-T cell doses were higher in the early-toci group (median 5.99 versus 3.80~\texttimes ~106 cells/kg, P {$<$} 0.01). Peak CRS grades (range, 0 to 2) using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy consensus criteria, neurotoxicity rates, and rates of severe infections were similar between groups; however, the median CRS duration was 18.6 hours for the early-toci group versus 84.7 hours for the late-toci group. The median progression-free survival was 35.7 months in the early-toci group and 13.2 months in the late-toci group. While limited by small sample size and known confounders such as CAR-T cell dose, our analysis suggests that preemptive toci strategies for CRS management with BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy\textemdash specifically, toci administration within 12 hours of the first fever attributed to CRS\textemdash do not appear to increase rates of therapy-related toxicities or compromise efficacy. However, total CRS duration may be shorter with early-toci workflows. Prospective validation of our findings may lead to improved safety and cost-effectiveness profiles for CAR-T therapy in RRMM.},

METHODS: A review of the available approaches to modelling in the economic evaluation of health care interventions with a leading discussion of examples of published studies leading to guidance in the selection of an appropriate approach in different circumstances. RESULTS: The main approaches to modelling used in economic evaluations in health care are decision trees, Markov models and individual sampling models. These methods assume independence of individuals within the model. Where interaction between individuals is important, other methods such as discrete-event simulation or system dynamics are preferable. CONCLUSIONS: The paper highlights the crucial question to be answered when selecting the approach to modelling: can the individuals being simulated in the model be regarded as independent? This issue is very commonly not recognised by analysts but is fundamental to the appropriate application of modelling in economic evaluation.},

  abstract = {Objective Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is a variant of endometrial cancer that is aggressive and associated with poor outcomes. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of carboplatin/paclitaxel alone versus carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab among patients with Her2/neu-positive advanced or recurrent UPSC. Methods We designed a Markov model in TreeAge Pro 2019 software to simulate management of a theoretical cohort of 4000 patients with Her2/neu-positive advanced or recurrent uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) followed for four years. In the carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab strategy, we included the cost of testing for Her2/neu status. We obtained all model inputs from the literature and a societal perspective was assumed. Outcomes included progression-free survival, progression, UPSC-specific mortality, cost, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The intervention was considered cost effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the robustness of the results. Results In our theoretical cohort of 4000 women, treatment with the addition of trastuzumab resulted in 637 fewer deaths and 627 fewer cases of progression compared with treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone. Treatment with trastuzumab was associated with an additional cost of \$144,335,895, but was associated with an increase of 2065 QALYs. The ICER was \$69,903 per QALY, which was below our willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this treatment strategy was cost-effective until the cost of 6~months of treatment surpassed \$38,505 (baseline input: \$27,562). Conclusion We found that the addition of trastuzumab to carboplatin/paclitaxel was a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with advanced/recurrent Her2/neu-positive UPSC.},

However, the relationships among age, disease risk, and prostate cancer\textendash specific survival have not been well established. Patients and Methods We studied men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database with complete risk, treatment, and follow-up information. High-risk patients were identified by using the validated Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. Competing risks regression was used to identify the independent impact of age on cancer-specific survival. We also analyzed the effect of local treatment on survival among older men with high-risk disease. Results In all, 26\% of men age {$\geq$} 75 years presented with high-risk disease (CAPRA score 6 to 10). Treatment varied markedly with age across risk strata; older men were more likely to receive androgen deprivation monotherapy. Controlling for treatment modality alone, or for treatment and risk, age did not independently predict cancer-specific survival. Furthermore, controlling for age, comorbidity, and risk, older men with high-risk tumors receiving local therapy had a 46\% reduction in mortality compared with those treated conservatively. Conclusion Older patients are more likely to have high-risk prostate cancer at diagnosis and less likely to receive local therapy. Indeed, underuse of potentially curative local therapy among older men with high-risk disease may in part explain observed differences in cancer-specific survival across age strata. These findings support making decisions regarding treatment on the basis of disease risk and life expectancy rather than on chronologic age.},

This paper updates a review of published papers between 1990 and 2000 for the years 2001\textendash 2008. Based on this previous review, and a number of other key review papers, focus is given to three issues: experimental design; estimation procedures; and validity of responses. Consideration is also given to how DCEs are applied and reported. We identified 114 DCEs, covering a wide range of policy questions. Applications took place in a broader range of health-care systems, and there has been a move to incorporating fewer attributes, more choices and interview-based surveys. There has also been a shift towards statistically more efficient designs and flexible econometric models. The reporting of monetary values continues to be popular, the use of utility scores has not gained popularity, and there has been an increasing use of odds ratios and probabilities. The latter are likely to be useful at the policy level to investigate take-up and acceptability of new interventions. Incorporation of interactions terms in the design and analysis of DCEs, explanations of risk, tests of external validity and incorporation of DCE results into a decision-making framework remain important areas for future research.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphomas (FLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas. No standard of care exists, and the management of these patients is highly individualized. METHODS: After reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the prognosis and management of FLs, we describe recent developments in treatment and discuss future trends in the care of patients with this disease. RESULTS: With the exception of a subset of patients with limited-stage FL treated with radiation therapy, no curative treatment exists for the majority of patients with FL. The decision on when to start treatment is based on the presence of symptoms, bulky disease, or abnormalities in hematologic parameters that can be attributed to FL. Prognostic scoring systems such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index help in assessing prognosis but do not contribute to the decision on when to start treatment. There are numerous effective chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of advanced-stage FL, but none show a definitive improvement in overall survival. Maintenance and consolidation regimens have also been shown to be effective treatments of FL, with significant improvements in progression-free survival and possibly overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Newer prognostic tests are in development that may help to guide the decision on which patients may benefit from early treatment. In addition, newer targeted agents that may improve on existing outcomes with less toxicity are currently being evaluated.},

Data from two randomized controlled trials in depression and diabetes were used. Utility value distributions were compared, and mean differences in utility values between the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk and the 5L value set were described by country. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the area-under-the-curve method. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and uncertainty around ICERs was estimated using bootstrapping and graphically shown in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. For all countries investigated, utility value distributions differed between the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk and 5L value set. In both case studies, mean utility values were lower for the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk compared with the 5L value set in England and Spain, but higher in the Netherlands. However, these differences in utility values did not translate into relevant differences across utility estimation methods in incremental QALYs and the interventions' probability of cost-effectiveness. Thus, our results suggest that EQ-5D-5L crosswalks and 5L value sets can be used interchangeably in patients affected by mild or moderate conditions. Further research is needed to establish whether these findings are generalizable to economic evaluations among severely ill patients.},

Patients enrolled in managed care organizations who initiated anti-hypertensive therapy coincident with lipid-lowering therapy (no more than 90 days apart) between January 1, 1997, and April 30, 2000, were eligible for inclusion. Analysis was limited to new users of anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. The proportion of days covered (PDC) by antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was calculated for the first year after therapy initiation; patients with a PDC of {$\geq$}80\% for both drug classes were considered adherent. Prescription burden Suite 303, Falls Church, VA 22046 (rchapman@us.imshealth.com). was defined as the number of prescription medications taken in the year prior to starting antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Demographic, clinical, and health-service-use variables associated with both prescription burden and medication adherence were measured using medical and pharmacy claims data from the year before initiation of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Results. Among 5759 patients, the mean {$\pm$} S.D. prescription burden was 3.6 {$\pm$} 3.7 (median, 3) medications, and the mean {$\pm$} S.D. PDC with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was 53.9\% {$\pm$} 31.9\% (me-dian, 58.5\%).

Among patients with 10 or more prior medications, 20\% were adherent. Conclusion. Among patients in a managed care database taking antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, adherence to those regimens became less likely as the number of prescription medications increased. The reduction in adherence with additional prescription medications was greatest in patients with the fewest preex-isting prescriptions.},

The protocol focused on: (1) Intensive chemotherapy preceding allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in early bone marrow relapse; (2) Rotational chemotherapy in late relapse, without donor; (3) Postponement of cerebro-spinal irradiation in late isolated CNS relapse; and (4) Treatment in very late bone marrow relapse with chemotherapy only. Methods From January 1999 until July 2006 all 158 Dutch pediatric patients with ALL in first relapse were recorded. Ninety-nine patients were eligible; 54 patients with early and 45 with late relapse. Eighteen patients had an isolated extra-medullary relapse; 69 patients had bone marrow involvement only. Results Five-years EFS rates for early and late relapses were 12\% and 35\%, respectively. For early relapses 5 years EFSs were 25\% for patients transplanted; 0\% for non-transplanted patients. For late relapses 5 years EFS was 64\% for patients treated with chemotherapy only, and 16\% for transplanted patients. For very late relapses EFS was 58\%. Conclusions Our data suggest the superiority of SCT for early relapse patients. For late relapses a better outcome is achieved with chemotherapy only using the rotational chemotherapy scheme.

Many proposed definitions focus on data, information, and knowledge, but do not provide an adequate definition of these terms. Leveraging insights from the philosophy of information, we define informatics as the science of information, where information is data plus meaning. Biomedical informatics is the science of information as applied to or studied in the context of biomedicine. Defining the object of study of informatics as data plus meaning clearly distinguishes the field from related fields, such as computer science, statistics and biomedicine, which have different objects of study. The emphasis on data plus meaning also suggests that biomedical informatics problems tend to be difficult when they deal with concepts that are hard to capture using formal, computational definitions. In other words, problems where meaning must be considered are more difficult than problems where manipulating data without regard for meaning is sufficient. Furthermore, the definition implies that informatics research, teaching, and service should focus on biomedical information as data plus meaning rather than only computer applications in biomedicine.},

  abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an expensive lifesaving procedure, which is increasingly performed in patients with haematological diseases. Developments in the protocol for SCT have resulted in cost estimates that require updating. We aimed to calculate actual costs for SCT and to identify major cost drivers by means of a daily practice cost study. We randomly selected 191 patients, treated at three university hospitals, who underwent an autologous (auto) SCT or allogeneic (allo) SCT in 2007, 2008 or 2009. Allo-SCT included sibling donors, matched unrelated donors (MUD) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). Resource use was collected from the hospital registration systems and medical files. The total costs included selection and harvesting of stem cells, transplantation and 1-year follow-up. The average costs per patient were 45,670 \texteuro{} for auto-SCT and 101,919 \texteuro{} for sibling allo-SCT. The costs of transplantations from unrelated donors were much higher: 171,478 \texteuro{} for allo-SCT-MUD and 254,689 \texteuro{} for allo-SCT-UCB. Hospital inpatient days together with laboratory and other activities were the main cost drivers across all types of SCT. Besides, donor search costs were a large cost component in allo-SCT-sib (18 \%) and allo-SCT-MUD (12 \%). Real-world costs were above routine reimbursement and appropriate financing is necessary to guarantee the continuation of SCT. The costs calculated in this study provide reliable up-to-date input for cost-effectiveness studies and budget revision.},

  abstract = {Objectives On the basis of two population-based registries, our study aims to calculate the real-world cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared with observation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients who responded to second-line chemotherapy. Methods Data were obtained from the EORTC20981 trial, the Netherlands Cancer Registry and two population-based registries. A Markov model was developed to calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for three scenarios. Results Our real-world patients were (62 years) 6 to 7 years older and had higher complete response rates to second-line chemotherapy than the trial population. Differences between the real-world rituximab and observation group were observed for second-line chemotherapy and disease progression. Groups were more balanced after using propensity matching. Relying entirely on updated trial results (scenario1) in combination with local cost data resulted in ratios of \texteuro 11 259 per LYG and \texteuro 12 655 per QALY. For scenario2, consisting of trial efficacy and matched real-world costs, ratios of \texteuro 21 202 per LYG and \texteuro 23 821 per QALY were calculated. Using real-world matched evidence (scenario3) for both effectiveness and costs showed ratios of \texteuro 10 591 per LYG and \texteuro 11 245 per QALY. Conclusion Although differences in real-world and trial population were found, using real-world data as well as results from long-term trial follow-up showed favourable ICERs for rituximab maintenance. Nevertheless, results showed that caution is required with data synthesis, interpretation and generalisability of results. As different scenarios provide answers to different questions, we recommend healthcare decision-makers to recognise the importance of calculating several cost-effectiveness scenarios.},

  abstract = {Decision makers increasingly request evidence on the real-world cost effectiveness of a new treatment. There is, however, a lack of practical guidance on how to conduct an economic evaluation based on registry data and how this evidence can be used in actual decision making. This paper explains the required steps on how to perform a sound economic evaluation using examples from an economic evaluation conducted with real-world data from the Dutch Population based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies. There are three main issues related to using registry data: confounding by indication, missing data, and insufficient numbers of (comparable) patients. If encountered, it is crucial to accurately deal with these issues to maximize the internal validity and generalizability of the outcomes and their value to decision makers. Multivariate regression modeling, propensity score matching, and data synthesis are well-established methods to deal with confounding. Multiple imputation methods should be used in cases where data are missing at random. Furthermore, it is important to base the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new treatment compared with its alternative on comparable groups of (matched) patients, even if matching results in a small analytical population. Unmatched real-world data provide insights into the costs and effects of a treatment in a real-world setting. Decision makers should realize that real-world evidence provides extremely valuable and relevant policy information, but needs to be assessed differently compared with evidence derived from a randomized clinical trial.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of novel treatments for elderly ({$\geq$}66 yr) patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in daily practice by comparing real-world effects [overall survival (OS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and costs over time. Also, we calculate cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences commonly prescribed to predict effects and costs if patients had received a different treatment sequence. METHODS: Real-world data including patient and disease characteristics, treatment information and resource use were collected from 1054 elderly patients with MM. Patients received first-line treatment during 2004-2007 (cohort 1) and 2008-2013 (cohort 2). The two cohorts were compared using a patient-level simulation (PLS) model comprising regression models which used patient and disease characteristics to estimate time to next treatment and death. Effects and costs from cohort 2 were compared to 4 commonly prescribed real-world sequences. RESULTS: Utilisation of novel agents was higher for cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. Modelled average OS for cohort 1 was 38 months (median 25) and total costs \texteuro 44,200. OS for cohort 2 was 42 months (median 28) and total costs \texteuro 69,017. The model identified potential OS gains if all patients were to be treated using combinations containing thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib in that particular order. This sequence had, compared to real-world treatment, the most favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, \texteuro 24,618 per life year gained and \texteuro 34,875 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient-level model enabled to study the effects and costs of entire treatment sequences and to compare real-world treatment patterns over time. Increased utilisation of novel agents improved survival and increased costs for real-world patients with MM in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Decision making for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) not transplant eligible (NTE) is complicated by a lack of head-to-head comparisons of standards of care, the increase in the choice of treatment modalities, and the promising results that are rapidly evolving from studies with novel regimens. To support evidence-based decision making, we performed a network meta-analysis for NTE MM patients that synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and enables a comparison of all treatments. Relevant randomized clinical trials were identified by a systematic literature review in EMBASE\textregistered, MEDLINE\textregistered, MEDLINE\textregistered -in-Process and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for January 1999 to March 2016. Efficacy outcomes [i.e. the hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI) for progression-free survival] were extracted and synthesized in a random effects network-meta analysis. In total, 24 studies were identified including 21 treatments. According to the network-meta analysis, the HR for progression-free survival was favorable for all NTE MM treatments compared to dexamethasone (HR: 0.19-0.90). Daratumumab-bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone and bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide with bortezomib-thalidomide maintenance were identified as the most effective treatments (HR: 0.19, 95\%CI: 0.08-0.45 and HR: 0.22, 95\%CI: 0.10-0.51, respectively). HR and 95\%CI for currently recommended treatments, bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone, bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone, and lenalidomide-dexamethasone compared to dexamethasone, were 0.31 (0.16-0.59), 0.39 (0.20-0.75), and 0.44 (0.29-0.65), respectively. In addition to identifying the most effective treatment options, we illustrate the additional value and evidence of network meta-analysis in clinical practice. In the current treatment landscape, the results of network meta-analysis may support evidence-based decisions and ultimately help to optimize treatment and outcomes of NTE MM patients.},

Methods: The unit costs are calculated pragmatically based on regularly published sources. Thus, an easy update is possible. Results: This paper presents the calculated unit costs for outpatient medical care, inpatient care, informal and formal nursing care and pharmaceuticals from a societal perspective. Conclusion: The calculated unit costs can serve as a reference case in health economic evaluations and hence help to increase their comparability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The characterization of uncertainty is critical in cost-effectiveness analysis, particularly when considering whether additional evidence is needed. In addition to parameter and methodological uncertainty, there are other sources of uncertainty which include simplifications and scientific judgments that have to be made when constructing and interpreting a model of any sort. These have been classified in a number of different ways but can be referred to collectively as structural uncertainties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Separate reviews were undertaken to identify what forms these other sources of uncertainty take and what other forms of potential methods to explicitly characterize these types of uncertainties in decision analytic models. These methods were demonstrated through application to four decision models each representing one of the four types of uncertainty. RESULTS: These sources of uncertainty fall into four general themes: 1) inclusion of relevant comparators; 2) inclusion of relevant events; 3) alternative statistical estimation methods; and 4) clinical uncertainty.Two methods to explicitly characterize such uncertainties were identified: model selection and model averaging. In addition, an alternative approach, adding uncertain parameters to represent the source of uncertainty was also considered.The applications demonstrate that cost-effectiveness may be sensitive to these uncertainties and the methods used to characterize them. The value of research was particularly sensitive to these uncertainties and the methods used to characterize it. It is therefore important, for decision-making purposes, to incorporate such uncertainties into the modeling process. CONCLUSION: Only parameterizing the uncertainty directly in the model can inform the decision to conduct further research to resolve this source of uncertainty.},

A number of stakeholders, including some Member States, welcomed this initiative as it was considered to improve collaboration, reduce duplication and improve efficiency. There were however a number of concerns including its legal basis, the establishment of a single managing authority, the preservation of national jurisdiction over HTA decision-making and the voluntary/mandatory uptake of joint assessments by Member States. Areas covered: This paper presents the consolidated views and considerations on the original Proposal as set by the European Commission of a number of policy makers, payers, experts from pricing and reimbursement authorities and academics from across Europe. Expert commentary: The Proposal has since been extensively discussed at Council and while good progress has been achieved, there are still divergent positions. The European Parliament gave a number of recommendations for amendments. If the Proposal is approved, it is important that a balanced, improved outcome is achieved for all stakeholders. If not approved, the extensive contribution and progress attained should be sustained and preserved, and the best alternative solutions found.},

Occurrence of grade III/IV haematological AEs, defined according to CTC-NCI guidelines criteria, was derived from the laboratory registration. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 48 years; 56\% male. A healthcare perspective was adopted. Cost estimates are presented in 2006 euros.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Average cost of an episode of anaemia was 1,572 euro, of thrombocytopenia 2,955 euro, and of neutropenia 1,152 euro. The mean cost of febrile neutropenia amounted to 2,462 euro.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment costs of AEs varied considerably. However, apart from the cost of anaemia, the results presented seem to be in line with information from the international literature. The key limitations of the study concern the relatively small cohort of patients at a single centre, the retrospective design and the various treatment regimens of CML during the follow-up.},

There are several treatment methods available, including mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of MSC therapy performed in children with srAGVHD. Materials and Methods: MSC therapy was used in our center between November 2014 and December 2017 for 22 patients who developed srAGVHD. The patients were retrospectively evaluated in terms of treatment response and survival. Results: After application of MSCs, complete response was obtained in 45.5\% of the subjects, partial response was obtained in 13.6\%, and no response was obtained in 40.9\%. We found that 45.5\% of the patients were alive and 54.5\% had died and our treatment results were similar to those in the literature. Response to MSC treatment was found to be the only prognostic marker affecting mortality. Conclusion: MSC application is a treatment method that can be used safely together with other treatment methods in srAGVHD, a condition that has a high mortality rate. There are almost no acute side effects. There are also no serious long-term side effects in the literature. Prospective randomized studies are required to obtain high-quality data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The usefulness of Google Scholar (GS) as a bibliographic database for biomedical systematic review (SR) searching is a subject of current interest and debate in research circles. Recent research has suggested GS might even be used alone in SR searching. This assertion is challenged here by testing whether GS can locate all studies included in 21 previously published SRs. Second, it examines the recall of GS, taking into account the maximum number of items that can be viewed, and tests whether more complete searches created by an information specialist will improve recall compared to the searches used in the 21 published SRs.METHODS:The authors identified 21 biomedical SRs that had used GS and PubMed as information sources and reported their use of identical, reproducible search strategies in both databases. These search strategies were rerun in GS and PubMed, and analyzed as to their coverage and recall. Efforts were made to improve searches that underperformed in each database.RESULTS:GS' overall coverage was higher than PubMed (98\% versus 91\%) and overall recall is higher in GS: 80\% of the references included in the 21 SRs were returned by the original searches in GS versus 68\% in PubMed. Only 72\% of the included references could be used as they were listed among the first 1,000 hits (the maximum number shown). Practical precision (the number of included references retrieved in the first 1,000, divided by 1,000) was on average 1.9\%, which is only slightly lower than in other published SRs. Improving searches with the lowest recall resulted in an increase in recall from 48\% to 66\% in GS and, in PubMed, from 60\% to 85\%.CONCLUSIONS:Although its coverage and precision are acceptable, GS, because of its incomplete recall, should not be used as a single source in SR searching. A specialized, curated medical database such as PubMed provides experienced searchers with tools and functionality that help improve recall, and numerous options in order to optimize precision. Searches for SRs should be performed by experienced searchers creating searches that maximize recall for as many databases as deemed necessary by the search expert.},

  abstract = {Models for the economic evaluation of health technologies provide valuable information to decision makers. The choice of model structure is rarely discussed in published studies and can affect the results produced. Many papers describe good modelling practice, but few describe how to choose from the many types of available models. This paper develops a new taxonomy of model structures. The horizontal axis of the taxonomy describes assumptions about the role of expected values, randomness, the heterogeneity of entities, and the degree of non-Markovian structure. Commonly used aggregate models, including decision trees and Markov models require large population numbers, homogeneous sub-groups and linear interactions. Individual models are more flexible, but may require replications with different random numbers to estimate expected values. The vertical axis of the taxonomy describes potential interactions between the individual actors, as well as how the interactions occur through time. Models using interactions, such as system dynamics, some Markov models, and discrete event simulation are fairly uncommon in the health economics but are necessary for modelling infectious diseases and systems with constrained resources. The paper provides guidance for choosing a model, based on key requirements, including output requirements, the population size, and system complexity.

  abstract = {Markov models are often employed to represent stochastic processes, that is, random processes that evolve over time. In a healthcare context, Markov models are particularly suited to modelling chronic disease. In this article, we describe the use of Markov models for economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. The intuitive way in which Markov models can handle both costs and outcomes make them a powerful tool for economic evaluation modelling. The time component of Markov models can offer advantages of standard decision tree models, particularly with respect to discounting. This paper gives a comprehensive description of Markov modelling for economic evaluation, including a discussion of the assumptions on which the type of model is based, most notably the memoryless quality of Markov models often termed the 'Markovian assumption'. A hypothetical example of a drug intervention to slow the progression of a chronic disease is employed to demonstrate the modelling technique and the possible methods of analysing Markov models are explored. Analysts should be aware of the limitations of Markov models, particularly the Markovian assumption, although the adept modeller will often find ways around this problem.},

In particular, no sample size formula for cost-ef fectiveness analysis is available for analysts hoping either to calculate the required sample size at the design stage of a study or to calculate the power a given size of clinical trial will generate for cost-effectiveness analysis. Building on the recent liter ature for calculating confidence intervals for cost-effectiveness ratios, the authors ex plore possible techniques for deriving a sample size formula for cost-effectiveness analysis based on simple combination of the confidence limits on costs and effects.

However, even when economic evaluations are conducted alongside clinical trials, some form of modelling is usually essential. The aim of this article is to review the handling of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results that are generated by the use of decision-analytic-type modelling. The modelling process is split into a number of stages: (i) a set of methods to be employed in a study are defined, which should include a `reference case' of agreed methods to enhance the comparability of results; (ii) the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients the model relates to should be specified as carefully as in any experimental study; and (iii) the data requirements of the model should be estimated using the principles of Bayesian statistics, such that prior distributions are specified for unknown model parameters. Monte Carlo simulation can then be employed to sample from these prior distributions to obtain a distribution of the cost effectiveness of the intervention. Such probabilistic analyses are related to parameter uncertainty. In addition, modelling uncertainty is likely to add a further layer of uncertainty to the results of particular analyses.},

  abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value of information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, in terms of both deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Expectations about the budget impact of new drug launches may affect payer behavior and ultimately consumer costs. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of pre-launch US budget impact estimates for a sample of new drugs. METHODS: We searched for publicly available budget impact estimates made pre-launch for drugs approved in the US from 1 September 2010 to 1 September 2015 and compared them to actual sales. Accuracy was calculated as the ratio of pre-launch estimate to actual sales. Quantitative analyses, including multivariate regressions, were used to identify factors associated with accuracy. RESULTS: We identified 25 budget impact estimates: 23 for one of 14 individual drugs and 2 for the category of PCSK9 inhibitors. The ratios of predicted to actual budget impact ranged from 0.2 (estimate was 20\% of sales) for secukinumab to 37.5 (estimate was 37.5\,\texttimes\,sales) for PCSK9 inhibitors. Mean ratio was 5.5. In multivariate analyses, larger eligible population, more recent estimate year (e.g. 2015 vs. 2012), and being first in class, were associated with statistically significant, greater overestimation of budget impact. CONCLUSIONS: For every \$5.5 of predicted cost, there was \$1 of actual cost to the healthcare system. This study, although based on a small, non-random sample, suggests possible cognitive bias on the part of the estimators. Overestimating budget impact may lead to early access restrictions, higher copays, and other changes that ultimately impact patients. Analysts and non-profits should be attuned to likely sources of error in order to improve their predictions.},

The goal of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment of SMA I patients with AVXS-101 in The Netherlands including relapse scenarios. Methods An individual-based state-transition model was used to model treatment effect and survival of SMA I patients treated with AVXS-101, nusinersen and best supportive care (BSC). The model included five health states: three health states according to SMA types, one for permanent ventilation and one for death. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Effects of relapsing to lower health states in the years following treatment was explored. Results The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for AVXS-101 versus BSC is \texteuro 138\,875/QALY, and \texteuro 53\,447/QALY for AVXS-101 versus nusinersen. If patients relapse within 10 years after treatment with AVXS-101, the ICER can increase up to 6-fold, with effects diminishing thereafter. Only relapses occurring later than 50 years after treatment have a negligible effect on the ICER. To comply with Dutch willingness-to-pay reference values, the price of AVXS-101 must decrease to \texteuro 680\,000. Conclusions Based on this model, treatment with AVXS-101 is unlikely to be cost-effective under Dutch willingness-to-pay reference values. Uncertainty regarding the long-term curative properties of AVXS-101 can result in multiplication of the ICER. Decision-makers are advised to appropriately balance these uncertainties against the price they are willing to pay now.},

Nevertheless, this broad perspective may be in conflict with the narrower perspective of the health-care decision-makers we are usually trying to aid. In this article, it is argued that not all costs have to be considered equally important for health-care decision-making and that there is a discrepancy between the economically preferred societal perspective and the aim of aiding health-care decisionmakers. This is related to the concept of local rationality. Three reasons why some costs may be considered more important for health-care decision-makers than others are: 1) relevance; 2) equity; and 3) responsibility. We suggest that it may be useful to adopt a two-perspective approach as a standard, presenting one cost-effectiveness ratio following a strict health-care perspective and one following the common societal perspective. The healthcare perspective may assist the health-care policymaker better in achieving health-care goals, while the societal perspective indicates whether the local rationality of the narrow health-care perspective is also in line with societal optimality. More research on actual decisions should provide more insight into the relative weights attached to different types of costs.},

  abstract = {Background Malignant blood disorders are a leading contributor to cancer incidence and mortality across Europe. Despite their burden, no study has assessed the economic effect of blood cancers in Europe. We aimed to assess the economic burden of malignant blood disorders across the 28 countries in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. Methods Malignant blood disorder-related costs were estimated for 28 EU countries, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland for 2012. Country-specific costs were estimated with aggregate data on morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use obtained from international and national sources. Health-care costs were estimated from expenditure on primary, outpatient, emergency, inpatient care, and drugs. Costs of informal care and productivity losses due to morbidity and early death were also included. For countries in the EU, malignant blood disorders were compared with the economic burden of overall cancer. Findings Malignant blood disorders cost the 31 European countries \texteuro 12 billion in 2012. Health-care cost \texteuro 7{$\cdot$}3 billion (62\% of total costs), productivity losses cost \texteuro 3{$\cdot$}6 billion (30\%), and informal care cost \texteuro 1 billion (8\%). For the EU countries, malignant blood disorders cost \texteuro 6{$\cdot$}8 billion (12\%) of the total health-care expenditure on cancer (\texteuro 57 billion), with this proportion being second only to breast cancer. In terms of total cancer costs in the EU (\texteuro 143 billion), malignant blood disorders cost \texteuro 12 billion (8\%). Interpretation Malignant blood disorders represent a leading cause of death, health-care service use, and costs, not only to European health-care systems, but to society overall. Our results add to essential public health knowledge needed for effective national cancer-control planning and priorities for public research funding. Funding European Hematology Association.},

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab monotherapy (RAM), compared with best supportive care (BSC), was based on data from the REGARD trial. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab combination therapy (RAM + PAC), compared with paclitaxel monotherapy (PAC), was based on data from the RAINBOW trial. In addition, the company undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare RAM + PAC with BSC and docetaxel. Cost-effectiveness evidence of monotherapy and combination therapy relied on partitioned survival, cost-utility models. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the company was pound188,640 (vs BSC) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for monotherapy and pound118,209 (vs BSC) per QALY gained for combination therapy. The ERG assessment indicated that the modelling structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. The ERG provided a new base case, with ICERs (vs BSC) of pound188,100 (monotherapy) per QALY gained and pound129,400 (combination therapy) per QALY gained and conducted additional exploratory analyses. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), considered the company's decision problem was in line with the NICE scope, with the exception of the choice of comparators for the combination therapy model. The most plausible ICER for ramucirumab monotherapy compared with BSC was pound188,100 per QALY gained. The Committee considered that the ERG's exploratory analysis in which RAM + PAC was compared with PAC by using the direct head-to-head data (including utilities) from the RAINBOW trial, provided the most plausible ICER (i.e. pound408,200 per QALY gained) for ramucirumab combination therapy. The Committee concluded that end-of-life considerations cannot be applied for either case, since neither failed to offer an extension to life of at least 3 months. The company did not submit a patient access scheme (PAS). After consideration of the evidence, the Committee concluded that ramucirumab alone or with paclitaxel could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources for treating advanced GC/GOJ patients that were previously treated with chemotherapy, and therefore its use could not be recommended. We might wonder if a complete STA process is necessary for treatments without a PAS, which are, according to the company's submission, already associated with ICERs far above the currently accepted threshold in all (base-case, sensitivity and scenario) analyses.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the manufacturer of pomalidomide (POM; Imnovid((R)), Celgene) to submit evidence regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with dexamethasone (POM + LoDEX) for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after at least two regimens including lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib (BOR). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft((R)) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately pound45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately pound143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately pound49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed in the PAS.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as part of the institute's single technology appraisal process, invited the manufacturer of ribociclib (Kisqali\textregistered, Novartis) to submit evidence regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of previously untreated, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group for this submission. The Evidence Review Group reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, corrected and validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This article describes the company submission, the Evidence Review Group assessment and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence subsequent decisions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from the MONALEESA-2 trial, a randomised controlled trial comparing ribociclib plus letrozole with placebo plus letrozole. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib group (95\% confidence interval, 19.3-not reached) vs. 14.7 months (95\% confidence interval 13.0-16.5) in the placebo group. To assess the cost effectiveness of ribociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, the company developed an individual patient-level model using a discrete-event simulation approach in Microsoft\textregistered{} Excel. In the model, simulated patients move through a series of three health states until death, i.e. first-line progression-free survival, second-line progression-free survival and progressive disease. The length of progression-free survival during the first line was informed by the MONALEESA-2 trial. The benefit in progression-free survival in the first line was transferred to a benefit in overall survival assuming full progression-free survival to overall survival surrogacy (because of the immaturity of overall survival data from the MONALEESA-2 trial). Patient-level data from the BOLERO-2 trial, evaluating the addition of everolimus to exemestane in the second-line treatment of postmenopausal HR-positive advanced breast cancer, were used to inform the length of progression-free survival during the second line. Costs included in the model were treatment costs (e.g. technology acquisition costs of first, second, third and/or later line treatments), drug administration costs, monitoring costs and health state costs (including terminal care). Additionally, the costs of adverse events associated with the first-line treatment were incorporated. The Evidence Review Group recalculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using data from a different data cut-off date from the MONALEESA-2 trial and by changing some assumptions (e.g. progression-free survival to overall survival surrogacy approach and post-progression third and/or later line treatment-related costs). After two appraisal committee meetings and a revised base case submitted by the company (including a second enhanced patient access scheme discount), the committee concluded that taking into account the uncertainties in the calculation of the cost effectiveness, there were plausible cost-effectiveness estimates broadly in the range that could be considered as a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources. Therefore, ribociclib was recommended as a treatment option for the first-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, contingent on the company providing ribociclib with the discount agreed in the second enhanced patient access scheme.},

  abstract = {This is the second in a series of occasional notes on economics Before an economic evaluation begins, the perspective of the study should be determined, as it may have implications for trial design.1 Since economic evaluations are often used to assess the relative efficiency of alternative healthcare interventions, the perspective commonly taken is that of the health service.2 Because of its foundations in welfare economics, however, health economics is concerned with society's welfare. It therefore argues that an economic evaluation should include the impact of an intervention on the welfare of the whole of society, not just on the individuals or organisations directly involved. Central to economic theory is the question of how to get the most benefit from the scarce resources available to a society. An economic evaluation which confined itself to the NHS's perspective could determine the mix of interventions that would maximise health outcomes within the limited NHS budget. However, this would not necessarily maximise the welfare of society within resources available (gross national \ldots},

At the same time, increasing numbers of patients are receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) prior to hematopoietic stem cell infusion. In prior work using smaller patient numbers and limited data, RIC peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation was shown to be noninferior to RIC bone marrow (BM) transplantation for acute leukemia. A recent, large registry analysis from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation showed that peripheral blood grafts result in superior outcomes compared with BM after RIC regimens for acute leukemia. The T-cell-replete PBSC allografts are associated with significant graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefits that are important drivers of improved leukemia-free survival and overall survival. However, an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after peripheral blood grafts is concerning and long-term follow-up comparing peripheral versus BM grafts after RIC regimens is needed. Further assessment of the long-standing risks should be undertaken in an effort to better understand whether the risk of cGVHD among peripheral blood graft recipients translates into continued GVL effects and long-term remissions and cures or if it results in late morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Twenty percent of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) experience progression of disease (POD) within 2 years of initial chemoimmunotherapy. We analyzed data from the National LymphoCare Study to identify whether prognostic FL factors are associated with early POD and whether patients with early POD are at high risk for death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 588 patients with stage 2 to 4 FL received first-line rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Two groups were defined: patients with early POD 2 years or less after diagnosis and those without POD within 2 years, the reference group. An independent validation set, 147 patients with FL who received first-line R-CHOP, was analyzed for reproducibility. RESULTS: Of 588 patients, 19\% (n = 110) had early POD, 71\% (n = 420) were in the reference group, 8\% (n = 46) were lost to follow-up, and 2\% (n = 12) died without POD less than 2 years after diagnosis. Five-year overall survival was lower in the early-POD group than in the reference group (50\% v 90\%). This trend was maintained after we adjusted for FL International Prognostic Index (hazard ratio, 6.44; 95\% CI, 4.33 to 9.58). Results were similar for the validation set (FL International Prognostic Index-adjusted hazard ratio, 19.8). CONCLUSION: In patients with FL who received first-line R-CHOP, POD within 2 years after diagnosis was associated with poor outcomes and should be further validated as a standard end point of chemoimmunotherapy trials of untreated FL. This high-risk FL population warrants further study in directed prospective clinical trials.},

  abstract = {lipidaemia-two conditions that, together with age, increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Adherence to antihypertensive (AH) and lipid-lowering (LL) therapy is therefore particularly important in older patients with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Objective: To determine patterns and predictors of adherence to concomitant AH and LL therapy among an older Medicare-eligible population. Methods: Enrolees (n = 4052) aged {$\geq$}65 years who initiated treatment with both AH and LL therapy within a 90-day period were studied in this retrospective cohort study conducted in a US managed care organization. Adherence to AH and LL medications was measured as the proportion of days covered by any AH and/ or LL medication in each 3-month interval, from the start of concomitant therapy for up to 36 months (mean follow-up 19.5 months). In each interval, patients were considered 'adherent' to AH and LL therapy if they had filled prescriptions sufficient to cover {$\geq$}80\% of days with both medication classes. A multivariable regression model evaluated potential predictors of adherence to concomitant therapy, including patient demographics, clinical characteristics and health services use patterns at baseline. Results: The percentage of patients adherent to both AH and LL therapy declined rapidly, before stabilizing, with 40.5\%, 32.7\% and 32.9\% adherent at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. At each timepoint, an additional 27.8-35.0\% of patients were adherent to either AH or LL therapy, but not both. Adherence was on average greater to AH than LL therapy. After adjusting for age, sex and other potential predictors, patients were more likely to be adherent if AH/LL therapies were initiated closer together in time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.13 for 0-30 days vs 61-90 days, p = 0.0563), had a history of cardiovascular disease (AOR 1.27, p = 0.0004), took fewer additional medications (AOR 0.43 for six or more medications vs zero or one medication, p {$<$} 0.0001) or had more outpatient 886 Chapman et al. physician visits in the prior year (AOR 1.26 for four to six visits vs zero to one visit, p {$<$} 0.0027). Conclusion: Adherence to concomitant AH and LL therapy among older adults is poor. Modifiable factors that may improve adherence in Medicare-eligible patients include initiating therapy concurrently and reducing patients' overall pill burden.

  abstract = {Background Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT) consolidation following frontline therapy can improve progression-free survival for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), but the cost-effectiveness of these approaches with respect to observation has not been examined using a common modeling framework. Objectives To evaluate and compare the economic impact of MR and RIT consolidation versus observation, respectively, following the first-line induction therapy for patients with advanced-stage FL. Methods We developed Markov models to estimate patients' lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years (LYs) after MR, RIT, and observation following frontline FL treatment from the US payer's perspective. Progression risks, adverse event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical data of Primary RItuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First-line Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between MR/RIT and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Compared with observation, MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391 LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively, and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained was \$40,335 (PRIMA) or \$37,412 (ECOG) for MR and \$40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before first progression, whereas RIT had higher incremental costs of adverse events due to higher incidences of cytopenias. Conclusions MR and RIT following frontline FL therapy demonstrated favorable and similar cost-effectiveness profiles. The model results should be interpreted within the specific clinical settings of each trial. Selection of MR, RIT, or observation should be based on patient characteristics and expected trade-offs for these alternatives.},

  abstract = {Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been broadly used experimentally in various clinical contexts. The addition of MSCs to initial steroid therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) may improve patient outcomes. However, investigations regarding prognostic factors affecting the efficacy of MSC therapy for steroid-refractory aGVHD remain controversial. We thus conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials to determine possible prognostic factors affecting the efficacy of MSCs in treating steroid-refractory aGVHD. Methods and Findings Clinical trials using MSC therapy for steroid-refractory aGVHD were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases. A total of 6,963 citations were reviewed, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 301 patients from thirteen studies were included. Of these, 136 patients showed a complete response (CR), and 69 patients displayed a partial (PR) or mixed response (MR). In total, 205 patients exhibited overall response (ORR). Patients with skin steroid-refractory aGVHD showed a better clinical response than gastrointestinal (CR: odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI]: 1.05\textendash 3.57, p {$<$} 0.05) and liver (CR: OR = 2.30, 95\%CI: 1.12\textendash 4.69, p {$<$} 0.05, and ORR: OR = 2.93, 95\%CI: 1.06\textendash 8.08, p {$<$} 0.05) steroid-refractory aGVHD. Those with grade II steroid-refractory aGVHD exhibited a better clinical response following MSC therapy than recipients with grade III\textendash IV (CR: OR = 3.22, 95\%CI: 1.24\textendash 8.34, p {$<$} 0.05). Completion therapy may improve the CR but reduce ORR compared with induction therapy (CR: OR = 0.20, 95\%CI: 0.09\textendash 0.44, p {$<$} 0.05; ORR: OR = 2.18, 95\%CI: 1.17\textendash 4.05, p = 0.01). There was also a trend towards a better clinical response in children compared with adults (CR: OR = 2.41, 95\%CI: 1.01\textendash 5.73, p = 0.05). Conclusions Age, skin involvement, lower aGVHD grade, and the number of infusions are the main prognostic factors affecting the efficacy of MSC therapy for steroid-refractory aGVHD.},

The International Harmonization Project was convened to provide updated recommendations. RESULTS New guidelines are presented incorporating PET, IHC, and flow cytometry for definitions of response in non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Standardized definitions of end points are provided. CONCLUSION We hope that these guidelines will be adopted widely by study groups, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and regulatory agencies to facilitate the development of new and more effective therapies to improve the outcome of patients with lymphoma.},

METHODS: The International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 17:1244, 1999) were widely adopted, but required reassessment because of identified limitations and the increased use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry. The International Harmonization Project was convened to provide updated recommendations. RESULTS: New guidelines are presented incorporating PET, IHC, and flow cytometry for definitions of response in non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Standardized definitions of end points are provided. CONCLUSION: We hope that these guidelines will be adopted widely by study groups, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and regulatory agencies to facilitate the development of new and more effective therapies to improve the outcome of patients with lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Purpose:        We expanded the clinical usefulness of EPIC-CP (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite          for Clinical Practice) by evaluating its responsiveness to health related quality          of life changes, defining the minimally important differences for an individual patient          change in each domain and applying it to a sexual outcome prediction model.              Materials and Methods:        In 1,201 subjects from a previously described multicenter longitudinal cohort we modeled          the EPIC-CP domain scores of each treatment group before treatment, and at short-term          and long-term followup. We considered a posttreatment domain score change from pretreatment          of 0.5 SD or greater clinically significant and p {$\leq$}0.01 statistically significant.          We determined the domain minimally important differences using the pooled 0.5 SD of          the 2, 6,~12 and 24-month posttreatment changes from pretreatment values. We then          recalibrated an EPIC-CP based nomogram model predicting 2-year post-prostatectomy          functional erection from that developed using EPIC-26.              Results:        For each health related quality of life domain EPIC-CP was sensitive to~similar posttreatment          health related quality of life changes with time, as was~observed using EPIC-26. The          EPIC-CP minimally important differences in changes in the urinary incontinence, urinary          irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal domains were 1.0, 1.3,          1.2, 1.6 and 1.0, respectively. The EPIC-CP based sexual prediction model performed          well (AUC 0.76). It showed robust agreement with its EPIC-26 based counterpart with          10\% or less predicted probability differences between models in 95\% of individuals          and a mean {$\pm$} SD difference of 0.0 {$\pm$} 0.05 across all individuals.              Conclusions:        EPIC-CP is responsive to health related quality of life changes during convalescence          and it can be used to predict 2-year post-prostatectomy sexual outcomes. It can facilitate          shared medical decision making and patient centered care.},

Broadly, these include the following: (i) should probabilistic sensitivity analysis continue to be recommended as a means to characterize parameter uncertainty; (ii) which methods should be used to represent other sources of uncertainty; (iii) when can computationally expensive models be justified and is computation expense a sufficient justification for failing to express uncertainty; (iv) which summary measures of uncertainty should be used to present the results to decision makers; and (v) should formal methods be recommended to inform the assessment of the need for evidence and the consequences of an uncertain decision for the UK NHS?},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Published guidelines on the conduct of economic evaluations provide little guidance regarding the use and potential bias of the different costing methods. OBJECTIVES: Using microcosting and two gross-costing methods, we (1) compared the cost estimates within and across subjects, and (2) determined the impact on the results of an economic evaluation. METHODS: Microcosting estimates were obtained from the local health region and gross-costing estimates were obtained from two government bodies (one provincial and one national). Total inpatient costs were described for each method. Using an economic evaluation of sirolimus-eluting stents, we compared the incremental cost-utility ratios that resulted from applying each method. RESULTS: Microcosting, Case-Mix-Grouper (CMG) gross-costing, and Refined-Diagnosis-Related grouper (rDRG) gross-costing resulted in 4-year mean cost estimates of \$16,684, \$16,232, and \$10,474, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the cost per QALY gained was \$41,764 (95\% CI: \$41,182-\$42 346), \$42,538 (95\% CI: \$42 167-\$42 907), and \$36,566 (95\% CI: \$36,172-\$36,960) for microcosting, rDRG-derived and CMG-derived estimates, respectively (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Within subject, the three costing methods produced markedly different cost estimates. The difference in cost-utility values produced by each method is modest but of a magnitude that could influence a decision to fund a new intervention.},

The increasing costs of bringing products to the market, as well as increased utilization of pharmaceuticals contribute to increased pharmaceutical expenditure; however, appropriate pharmaceutical use can, in certain cases, reduce overall healthcare costs. Nevertheless, the perception of high drug prices still puts pressure on pharmaceutical companies to build confidence in the proposition that their products are worth the additional expense. One potential approach to building this confidence, and maintaining investment incentives, is for the pharmaceutical company to share the risk of a situation in which there is uncertainty about whether the product is effective for the consumer and payer. Such risk-sharing arrangements for pharmaceuticals, like warranties, can be used to signal high quality when product quality is not fully observable. While there may be difficulties in devising such schemes for every product, such risk-sharing plans may become a staple feature of the market in the future.},

These evaluations often use modelling techniques such as decision trees, Markov processes and discrete event simulations (DES). With the aid of examples from coronary heart disease, the use of these techniques in different health care situations is discussed. Guidelines for the choice of modelling technique are developed according to the characteristics of the health care intervention.The choice of modelling technique is shown to depend on the acceptance of the modelling technique, model `error', model appropriateness, dimensionality and ease and speed of model development. Generally decision trees are suitable for acute interventions but they cannot model recursion and Markov models are suitable for simple chronic interventions. It is further recommended that population based models be used in order to provide health care outcomes for the likely cost, health benefits and cost effectiveness of the intervention. The population approach will complicate the construction of the model. DES will allow the modeller to construct more complex, dynamic and accurate systems but these may involve a corresponding increase in development time and expense. The modeller will need to make a judgement on the necessary complexity of the model in terms of interaction of individuals and model size and whether queuing for resources, resource constraints or the interactions between individuals are significant issues in the health care system.},

  abstract = {The main rationale for using biosimilar drugs is for cost saving. The market development for biosimilar drugs will therefore depend on the degree to which cost saving measures are required by nations, medical insurers and individuals and the absolute savings that could be gained by switching from original drugs. This paper is designed to discover the degree to which financial constraints will drive future health spending and to discover if legal or safety issues could impact on any trend. A structured literature search was performed for papers and documents to 27 August 2011. Where multiple sources of data were available on a topic, data from papers and reports by multinational or national bodies were used in preference to data from regions or individual hospitals. Almost all health systems face current significant cost pressures. The twin driver of increasing cancer prevalence as populations age and cancer medicine costs rising faster than inflation places oncology as the most significant single cost problem. For some countries, this is predicted to make medicine unaffordable within a decade. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a cost-control measure. Biosimilar introduction into the EU has already forced prices down, both the price of biosimilar drugs and competitive price reductions in originator drugs. Compound annual growth rates of use have been predicted at 65.8\% per year. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a major cost-control measure. Only legal blocks and safety concerns are likely to act against this trend. For centralised healthcare systems, and those with a strong tradition of generic medicine use, biosimilar use will clearly rise with predictions of more than 80\% of prescriptions of some biologic drugs within 1~year of market entry in the USA. Delaying the implementation of such programmes however risks a real crisis in healthcare delivery for many countries and hospitals that few can now afford.},

  abstract = {Aims To construct and compare a partitioned-survival analysis (PartSA) and a semi-Markov multi-state model (MSM) to investigate differences in estimated cost effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment from a UK perspective. Materials and Methods Data from a cohort of late-stage cancer patients (N {$>$} 700) enrolled within a randomized, controlled trial were used to populate both modelling approaches. The statistical software R was used to fit parametric survival models to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) data to inform the PartSA (package ``flexsurv''). The package ``mstate'' was used to estimate the MSM transitions (permitted transitions: (T1) ``progression-free'' to ``dead'', (T2) ``post-progression'' to ``death'', and (T3) ``pre-progression'' to ``post-progression''). Key costs included were treatment-related (initial, subsequent, and concomitant), adverse events, hospitalizations and monitoring. Utilities were stratified by progression. Outcomes were discounted at 3.5\% per annum over a 15-year time horizon. Results The PartSA and MSM approaches estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of \textsterling 342,474 and \textsterling 411,574, respectively. Scenario analyses exploring alternative parametric forms provided incremental discounted life-year estimates that ranged from +0.15 to +0.33 for the PartSA approach, compared with -0.13 to +0.23 for the MSM approach. This variation was reflected in the range of ICERs. The PartSA produced ICERs between \textsterling 234,829 and \textsterling 522,963, whereas MSM results were more variable and included instances where the intervention was dominated and ICERs above \textsterling 7 million (caused by very small incremental QALYs). Limitations and conclusions Structural uncertainty in economic modelling is rarely explored due to time and resource limitations. This comparison of structural approaches indicates that the choice of structure may have a profound impact on cost-effectiveness results. This highlights the importance of carefully considered model conceptualization, and the need for further research to ascertain when it may be most appropriate to use each approach.},

These relationships make class attendance a better predictor of college grades than any other known predictor of academic performance, including scores on standardized admissions tests such as the SAT, high school GPA, study habits, and study skills. Results also show that class attendance explains large amounts of unique variance in college grades because of its relative independence from SAT scores and high school GPA and weak relationship with student characteristics such as conscientiousness and motivation.

  abstract = {Background Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the leading cause of late nonrelapse mortality (transplant-related mortality) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Given that there are a wide range of treatment options for cGvHD, assessment of the associated costs and efficacy can help clinicians and health care providers allocate health care resources more efficiently. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) compared with rituximab (Rmb) and with imatinib (Imt) in patients with cGvHD at 5 years from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. Methods The model assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness/utility ratio of ECP versus Rmb or Imt for 1000 hypothetical patients by using microsimulation cost-effectiveness techniques. Model probabilities were obtained from the literature. Treatment pathways and adverse events were evaluated taking clinical opinion and published reports into consideration. Local data on costs (2010 Euros) and health care resources utilization were validated by the clinical authors. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the model. Results The greater efficacy of ECP resulted in a gain of 0.011 to 0.024 quality-adjusted life-year in the first year and 0.062 to 0.094 at year 5 compared with Rmb or Imt. The results showed that the higher acquisition cost of ECP versus Imt was compensated for at 9 months by greater efficacy; this higher cost was partially compensated for (\texteuro 517) by year 5 versus Rmb. After 9 months, ECP was dominant (cheaper and more effective) compared with Imt. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECP versus Rmb was \texteuro 29,646 per life-year gained and \texteuro 24,442 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at year 2.5. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the results. The main study limitation was that to assess relative treatment effects, only small studies were available for indirect comparison. Conclusion ECP as a third-line therapy for cGvHD is a more cost-effective strategy than Rmb or Imt.},

A working correlation structure for the repeated measures of the outcome variable of a subject needs to be specified by this method. However, statistical criteria for selecting the best correlation structure and the best subset of explanatory variables in GEE are only available recently because the GEE method is developed on the basis of quasi-likelihood theory. Maximum likelihood based model selection methods, such as the widely used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are not applicable to GEE directly. Pan (2001) proposed a selection method called QIC which can be used to select the best correlation structure and the best subset of explanatory variables. Based on the QIC method, we developed a computing program to calculate the QIC value for a range of different distributions, link functions and correlation structures. This program was written in Stata software. In this article, we introduce this program and demonstrate how to use it to select the most parsimonious model in GEE analyses of longitudinal data through several representative examples.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice (observation) from the French National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab maintenance with observation. PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution. PFS and OS benefits of rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years. Utility data were obtained from a multicentre observational study using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Direct medical costs were obtained from French official sources. All costs are reported in euro, year 2006 values. RESULTS: The EORTC 20981 study demonstrated that rituximab maintenance was effective in the management of relapsed/refractory FL. The model results showed that life expectancy and QALYs were increased by 22\% and 28\%, respectively, in patients treated with rituximab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro 7612 per life-year gained and euro 8729 per QALY gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, most of the ICERs fell within the range of euro 7000-12,000. The results tend to show that rituximab maintenance therapy may be a cost-effective strategy in the management of relapsed/refractory FL in France, with ICERs below those observed for other therapies in the oncology field. The cost of rituximab was partly offset by the lower cost of relapse due to a longer time in the disease-free health state for patients in the rituximab arm.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Decreased cancer incidence and reported changes to clinical management indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in diagnostic and treatment delays for cancer patients. We aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. Methods: The stage-shift model estimates population-level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation, assuming delays lead to stage-progression. It allows for extrapolation of population-level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years. The model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6-month delays for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma, based on Australian data. In the absence of patient-level data about time to stage progression, two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay: 1) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal and lung cancer), and 2) based on the tumour growth rate (melanoma). The model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. Results: A shift from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated proportion of 3\% of the stage I patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage II, resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. For breast and lung cancer, progression from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5\% (breast cancer) and 8\% (lung cancer), resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years, and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon, respectively. For melanoma, with 32\% of T1 patients progressing to T2 disease following a 6-month delay, the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and \$12 million excess healthcare costs in Australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers. If the delays increase to 6 months, excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and \$46 million in Australia. More accurate data on stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical to obtain more reliable estimates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Translating prognostic and diagnostic biomarker candidates into clinical applications takes time, is very costly, and many candidates fail. It is therefore crucial to be able to select those biomarker candidates that have the highest chance of successfully being adopted in the clinic. This requires an early estimate of the potential clinical impact and commercial value. In this paper, we aim to demonstratively evaluate a set of novel biomarkers in terms of clinical impact and commercial value, using occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type-2 diabetes (DM2) patients as a case study. Methods: We defined a clinical application for the novel biomarkers, and subsequently used data from a large cohort study in The Netherlands in a modeling exercise to assess the potential clinical impact and headroom for the biomarkers. Results: The most likely application of the biomarkers would be to identify DM2 patients with a low CVD risk and subsequently withhold statin treatment. As a result, one additional CVD event in every 75 patients may be expected. The expected downstream savings resulted in a headroom for a point-of-care device ranging from \texteuro 119.09 at a willingness to accept of \texteuro 0 for one additional CVD event, to \texteuro 0 at a willingness to accept of \texteuro 15,614 or more. Conclusion: It is feasible to evaluate novel biomarkers on outcomes directly relevant to technological development and clinical adoption. Importantly, this may be attained at the same point in time and using the same data as used for the evaluation of association with disease and predictive power.},

  abstract = {While outcomes for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have improved dramatically, survival rates for patients with relapsed/refractory disease remain dismal. Prior studies indicate that glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is more common than resistance to other chemotherapies at relapse. In addition, failure to clear peripheral blasts during a prednisone prophase correlates with an elevated risk of relapse in newly diagnosed patients. Here we show that intrinsic GC resistance is present at diagnosis in early thymic precursor (ETP) T-ALLs as well as in a subset of non-ETP T-ALLs. GC-resistant non-ETP T-ALLs are characterized by strong induction of JAK/STAT signaling in response to interleukin-7 (IL7) stimulation. Removing IL7 or inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling sensitizes these T-ALLs, and a subset of ETP T-ALLs, to GCs. The combination of the GC dexamethasone and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib altered the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in samples with IL7-dependent GC resistance, but not in samples with IL7-independent GC resistance. Together, these data suggest that the addition of ruxolitinib or other inhibitors of IL7 receptor/JAK/STAT signaling may enhance the efficacy of GCs in a biologically defined subset of T-ALL.},

Thus, substantial scientific input is required as to what criteria must be met by each potential study. Much can be learned from combining or pooling data but it must be done cautiously. Pooling exercises do not replace well designed prospective clinical trials. Efforts for establishing basic design criteria to allow for multicentre and multicountry trials to be more easily combined might be useful.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable debate on the extent to which future costs should be included in cost-effectiveness analyses of health technologies. In this article, we summarize the theoretical debates and empirical research in this area and highlight the conclusions that can be drawn for current practice. For future related and future unrelated medical costs, the literature suggests that inclusion is required to obtain optimal outcomes from available resources. This conclusion does not depend on the perspective adopted by the decision maker. Future non-medical costs are only relevant when adopting a societal perspective; these should be included if the benefits of non-medical consumption and production are also included in the evaluation. Whether this is the case currently remains unclear, given that benefits are typically quantified in quality-adjusted life-years and only limited research has been performed on the extent to which these (implicitly) capture benefits beyond health. Empirical research has shown that the impact of including future costs can be large, and that estimation of such costs is feasible. In practice, however, future unrelated medical costs and future unrelated non-medical consumption costs are typically excluded from economic evaluations. This is explicitly prescribed in some pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Further research is warranted on the development and improvement of methods for the estimation of future costs. Standardization of methods is needed to enhance the practical applicability of inclusion for the analyst and the comparability of the outcomes of different studies. For future non-medical costs, further research is also needed on the extent to which benefits related to this spending are captured in the measurement and valuation of health benefits, and how to broaden the scope of the evaluation if they are not sufficiently captured.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the sensitivity and precision of Medline searching for randomised clinical trials. Design - Comparison of results of Medline searches to a ``gold standard'' of known randomised clinical trials in ophthalmology published in 1988; systematic review (meta-analysis) of results of similar, but separate, studies from many fields of medicine. Populations: Randomised clinical trials published in in 1988 in journals indexed in Medline, and those not indexed in Medline and identified by hand search, comprised the gold standard. Gold standards for the other studies combined in the meta-analysis were based on: randomised clinical trials published in any journal, whether indexed in Medline or not; those published in any journal indexed in Medline; or those published in a selected group of journals indexed in Medline. Main outcome measure - Sensitivity (proportion of the total number of known randomised clinical trails identified by the search) and precision (proportion of publications retrieved by Medline that were actually randomised clinical trials) were calculated for each study and combined to obtain weighted means. Searches producing the ``best'' sensitivity were used for sensitivity and precision estimates when multiple searches were performed. Results: The sensitivity of searching for ophthalmology randomised clinical trials published in 1988 was 82\%, when the gold standard was for any journal, 87\% for any journal indexed in Medline, and 88\% for selected journals indexed in Medline. Weighted means for sensitivity across all studies were 51\%, 77\%, and 63\%, respectively. The weighted mean for precision was 8\% (median 32.5\%). Most searchers seemed not to use freetext subject terms and truncation of those terms. Conclusion - Although the indexing terms available for searching Medline for randomised clinical trials have improved, sensitivity still remains unsatisfactory. A mechanism is needed to ``register'' known trials, preferably by retrospective tagging of Medline entries, and incorporating trials published before 1966 and in journals not indexed by Medline into the system.},

  abstract = {Four approaches to estimating a regression model for relative survival using the method of maximum likelihood are described and compared. The underlying model is an additive hazards model where the total hazard is written as the sum of the known baseline hazard and the excess hazard associated with a diagnosis of cancer. The excess hazards are assumed to be constant within pre-specified bands of follow-up. The likelihood can be maximized directly or in the framework of generalized linear models. Minor differences exist due to, for example, the way the data are presented (individual, aggregated or grouped), and in some assumptions (e.g. distributional assumptions). The four approaches are applied to two real data sets and produce very similar estimates even when the assumption of proportional excess hazards is violated. The choice of approach to use in practice can, therefore, be guided by ease of use and availability of software. We recommend using a generalized linear model with a Poisson error structure based on collapsed data using exact survival times. The model can be estimated in any software package that estimates GLMs with user-defined link functions (including SAS, Stata, S-plus, and R) and utilizes the theory of generalized linear models for assessing goodness-of-fit and studying regression diagnostics.

Increases in US population size were associated with a 23.1\% (uncertainty interval [UI], 23.1\%-23.1\%), or \$269.5 (UI, \$269.0-\$270.0) billion, spending increase; aging of the population was associated with an 11.6\% (UI, 11.4\%-11.8\%), or \$135.7 (UI, \$133.3-\$137.7) billion, spending increase. Changes in disease prevalence or incidence were associated with spending reductions of 2.4\% (UI, 0.9\%-3.8\%), or \$28.2 (UI, \$10.5-\$44.4) billion, whereas changes in service utilization were not associated with a statistically significant change in spending. Changes in service price and intensity were associated with a 50.0\% (UI, 45.0\%-55.0\%), or \$583.5 (UI, \$525.2-\$641.4) billion, spending increase. The influence of these 5 factors varied by health condition and type of care. For example, the increase in annual diabetes spending between 1996 and 2013 was \$64.4 (UI, \$57.9-\$70.6) billion; \$44.4 (UI, \$38.7-\$49.6) billion of this increase was pharmaceutical spending.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions and Relevance{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Increases in US health care spending from 1996 through 2013 were largely related to increases in health care service price and intensity but were also positively associated with population growth and aging and negatively associated with disease prevalence or incidence.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Cost-effectiveness analyses focused on benign thyroid diseases are under-represented in the literature. The calculation of costs per additionally gained life year is difficult: The benefit of prevention is shifted into the distant future. The influence of an untreated subclinical thyroid disease on life expectancy can only be demonstrated by a long-term follow-up and by epidemiological databases. Iodine supplementation and programs for the prevention of tobacco smoking (primary prevention) are very cost-effective. Smoking increases the risk both of multinodular goiter and of Graves' disease. Screening programs (secondary prevention) are discussed for the laboratory parameters thyrotropin (TSH), calcium and calcitonin. TSH testing seems to be very cost-effective for epidemiological considerations in a certain lifespan (newborn, pregnancy, postpartal, older persons, hospitalisation due to acute diseases) and in persons with previously elevated TPO-antibodies or TSH-values {$>$}2 mU/l, but dedicated cost-effectiveness analyses are lacking. On the other hand, the cost-effectiveness of a routine TSH testing beyond the age of 35 years has been shown by a high-quality decision analysis. Therapeutic strategies (tertiary prevention) aim at the avoidance of complications (atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, death for cardiac reasons) and of iatrogenic complications. Examples of a tertiary prevention are: firstly the definitive therapy of Graves' disease in patients who have an increased risk of relapse after antithyroid drugs (ATD), secondly the radioiodine therapy for subclinical hyperthyroidism and the radioiodine therapy of large goiters in older patients or in patients suffering from a relevant comorbidity. Cost-effectiveness analyses for different therapeutic strategies of Graves' disease were published using a lifelong time-horizon. The ablative radioiodine dose-regime is cost-effective as a first line therapy if the risk of relapse after ATD exceeds 60\%.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background We aimed to assess efficacy and tolerability of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Methods In our randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults ({$\geq$}18 years) at 174 university hospitals in 31 countries worldwide. Eligible patients had to have non-refractory multiple myeloma that previously responded to treatment (one to three regimens) but were currently progressing, ECOG performance statuses of 2 or less, and no continuing toxic effects from previous treatment. We excluded patients with known resistance to bortezomib. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) using an interactive voice response system to receive 21 day cycles of bortezomib (1{$\cdot$}3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11) in combination with oral vorinostat (400 mg) or matching placebo once-daily on days 1\textendash 14. We stratified patients by baseline tumour stage (International Staging System stage 1 or stage {$\geq$}2), previous bone-marrow transplantation (yes or no), and number of previous regimens (1 or {$\geq$}2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 00773747. Findings Between Dec 24, 2008, and Sept 8, 2011, we randomly allocated 317 eligible patients to the vorinostat group (315 of whom received at least one dose) and 320 to the placebo group (all of whom received at least one dose). Median PFS was 7{$\cdot$}63 months (95\% CI 6{$\cdot$}87\textendash 8{$\cdot$}40) in the vorinostat group and 6{$\cdot$}83 months (5{$\cdot$}67\textendash 7{$\cdot$}73) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}77, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}64\textendash 0{$\cdot$}94; p=0{$\cdot$}0100). 312 (99\%) of 315 patients in the vorinostat group and 315 (98\%) of 320 patients in the placebo group had adverse events (300 [95\%] adverse events in the vorinostat group and 282 [88\%] in the control group were regarded as related to treatment). The most common grade 3\textendash 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (143 [45\%] patients in the vorinostat group vs 77 [24\%] patients in the placebo group), neutropenia (89 [28\%] vs 80 [25\%]), and anaemia (53 [17\%] vs 40 [13\%]). Interpretation Although the combination of vorinostat and bortezomib prolonged PFS relative to bortezomib and placebo, the clinical relevance of the difference in PFS between the two groups is not clear. Different treatment schedules of bortezomib and vorinostat might improve tolerability and enhance activity. Funding Merck.},

  abstract = {Background Bortezomib with dexamethasone is a standard treatment option for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib with dexamethasone has shown promising activity in patients in this disease setting. The aim of this study was to compare the combination of carfilzomib and dexamethasone with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Methods In this randomised, phase 3, open-label, multicentre study, patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had one to three previous treatments were randomly assigned (1:1) using a blocked randomisation scheme (block size of four) to receive carfilzomib with dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or bortezomib with dexamethasone (bortezomib group). Randomisation was stratified by previous proteasome inhibitor therapy, previous lines of treatment, International Staging System stage, and planned route of bortezomib administration if randomly assigned to bortezomib with dexamethasone. Patients received treatment until progression with carfilzomib (20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1; 56 mg/m2 thereafter; 30 min intravenous infusion) and dexamethasone (20 mg oral or intravenous infusion) or bortezomib (1{$\cdot$}3 mg/m2; intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection) and dexamethasone (20 mg oral or intravenous infusion). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. All participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. The study is ongoing but not enrolling participants; results for the interim analysis of the primary endpoint are presented. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01568866. Findings Between June 20, 2012, and June 30, 2014, 929 patients were randomly assigned (464 to the carfilzomib group; 465 to the bortezomib group). Median follow-up was 11{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 9{$\cdot$}3\textendash 16{$\cdot$}1) in the carfilzomib group and 11{$\cdot$}1 months (8{$\cdot$}2\textendash 14{$\cdot$}3) in the bortezomib group. Median progression-free survival was 18{$\cdot$}7 months (95\% CI 15{$\cdot$}6\textendash not estimable) in the carfilzomib group versus 9{$\cdot$}4 months (8{$\cdot$}4\textendash 10{$\cdot$}4) in the bortezomib group at a preplanned interim analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}53 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}44\textendash 0{$\cdot$}65]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). On-study death due to adverse events occurred in 18 (4\%) of 464 patients in the carfilzomib group and in 16 (3\%) of 465 patients in the bortezomib group. Serious adverse events were reported in 224 (48\%) of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group and in 162 (36\%) of 456 patients in the bortezomib group. The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (67 [14\%] of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group vs 45 [10\%] of 456 patients in the bortezomib group), hypertension (41 [9\%] vs 12 [3\%]), thrombocytopenia (39 [8\%] vs 43 [9\%]), and pneumonia (32 [7\%] vs 36 [8\%]). Interpretation For patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, carfilzomib with dexamethasone could be considered in cases in which bortezomib with dexamethasone is a potential treatment option.

When conducting trial-based economic evaluations, researchers often turn to national pharmacoeconomic guidelines for guidance. Therefore, this study reviewed which recommendations are currently given by national pharmacoeconomic guidelines on the statistical analysis of trial-based economic evaluations. Areas covered 40 national pharmacoeconomic guidelines were identified. Data were extracted on the guidelines' recommendations on how to deal with baseline imbalances, skewed costs, correlated costs and effects, clustering of data, longitudinal data, and missing data in trial-based economic evaluations. Four guidelines (10\%) were found to include recommendations on how to deal with baseline imbalances, five (13\%) on how to deal with skewed costs, and seven (18\%) on how to deal with missing data. Recommendations were very general in nature and recommendations on dealing with correlated costs and effects, clustering of data, and longitudinal data were lacking. Expert opinion Current national pharmacoeconomic guidelines provide little to no guidance on how to deal with the statistical challenges to trial-based economic evaluations. Since the use of suboptimal statistical methods may lead to biased results, and, therefore, possibly to a waste of scarce resources, national agencies are advised to include more statistical guidance in their pharmacoeconomic guidelines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Treatment with CHOP chemotherapy in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is less effective and accompanied by more adverse effects than in younger patients. The prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) might improve the results, but increases the costs of treatment. We analyzed the costs of therapy and follow-up of patients with NHL treated with CHOP with or without G-CSF prophylaxis. DESIGN AND METHODS Four hundred and eleven patients were randomized for treatment with CHOP or CHOP+G-CSF. A detailed study of treatment costs from randomization until 3 years of follow-up or death was performed in a subset of 100 out of 389 eligible patients. Because costs during follow-up were independent of the use of G-CSF during treatment, costs of follow-up and second-line treatment were calculated irrespective of the treatment arm. RESULTS Total hospital costs for first-line treatment were 12178 [95\% CI 10297 - 14059] for CHOP alone and 18356 [95\% CI 15807 - 20906] for CHOP + G-CSF. Costs during follow-up showed a wide difference (range 74 - 53925) depending on disease status and choice of treatment in the case of relapse or progression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS The clinical study showed no difference between the treatment arms in response, overall survival or event-free survival, while the costs were significantly higher in the G-CSF arm. We conclude that the addition of prophylactic G-CSF to CHOP chemotherapy is not cost-effective in these patients.},

  abstract = {Background High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel therapy for prostate cancer. Owing to a lack of long-term data, HIFU is recommended for use only in the context of research. Objective To examine the trend for HIFU use nationally and rates of strictures and fistulae. Design, setting, and participants Patients undergoing HIFU for prostate cancer between April 2007 and March 2018 were studied in an English national database (Hospital Episode Statistics). Data on complications were included for patients with a minimum of 1-yr follow-up. Analysis of complications was controlled for other interventions. Outcome measures and statistical analysis Descriptive analyses of HIFU rates and the incidence of strictures and fistulae were carried out. Cox and logistic regression models were built for urethral stricture incidence. Results and limitations A total of 2320 HIFU treatments among 1990 patients were identified. The median age was 67yr (interquartile range 61\textendash 72). Some 1742 patients met the criteria for follow-up analysis. The highest-volume centre performed 1513 HIFU procedures, followed by 194 at the second highest. The number of HIFU procedures increased annually, rising from 196 to 283 per year. There were 208 patients (11.9\%) who went on to have radiotherapy and 102 (5.9\%) radical prostatectomy after HIFU. Following HIFU, stricture developed in 133/1290 patients (10.3\%) and urinary fistula in 16/1240 (1.3\%) before any further intervention. More recent years for HIFU were associated with a lower likelihood of stricture formation (2016/2017 vs 2007/2008: hazard ratio 0.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.11\textendash 0.79; p=0.015). Limitations include the lack of staging information and unknown rates of HIFU outside of publicly funded health care. Conclusions HIFU is performed at a large number of low-volume centres and complication rates do not differ from those for established therapies. Patient summary This report highlights the trend for provision of high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for prostate cancer in England. The results suggest that the rate of urethral structural complications may not be lower than that for established prostate cancer treatments.},

  abstract = {In the Dutch health care system, health insurers negotiate with hospitals about the pricing of hospital products in a managed competition framework. In this paper, we study these contract prices that became for the first time publicly available in 2016. The data show substantive price variation between hospitals for the same products, and within a hospital for the same product across insurers. About 27\% of the contract prices for a hospital product are at least 20\% higher or lower than the average contract price in the market. For about half of the products, the highest and the lowest contract prices across hospitals differ by a factor of three or more. Moreover, hospital product prices do not follow a consistent ranking across hospitals, suggesting substantial cross-subsidization between hospital products. Potential explanations for the large and seemingly random price variation are: (i) different cost pricing methods used by hospitals, (ii) uncertainty due to frequent changes in the hospital payment system, (iii) price adjustments related to negotiated lumpsum payments and (iv) differences in hospital and insurer market power. Several policy options are discussed to reduce variation and increase transparency of hospital prices.},

The conference convened {$\sim$}30 experts from all around Europe, and selected six lymphoma entities to be addressed; for each of them, three to five open questions were to be addressed by the experts. For each question, a recommendation should be given by the panel, referring to the strength of the recommendation based on the level of evidence. This consensus report focuses on the three less common lymphoproliferative malignancies: marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. A first report had focused on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate how the societal perspective is conceptualized in economic evaluations and to assess how intersectoral costs and benefits (ICBs), that is, the costs and benefits pertaining to sectors outside the healthcare sector, impact their results. Methods: Based on a search in July 2015 using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychINFO, a systematic literature review was performed for economic evaluations which were conducted from a societal perspective. Conceptualizations were assessed in NVivo version 11 using conventional and directed content analysis. Trial-based evaluations in the fields of musculoskeletal and mental disorders were analyzed further, focusing on the way ICBs impact the results of economic evaluations. Results: A total of 107 studies were assessed, of which 74 (69.1 percent) provided conceptualizations of the societal perspective. These varied in types of costs included and in descriptions of cost bearers. Labor productivity costs were included in seventy-two studies (67.3 percent), while only thirty-eight studies (35.5 percent) included other ICBs, most of which entailed informal care and/or social care costs. ICBs within the educational and criminal justice sectors were each included five times. Most of the trial-based evaluations analyzed further (n = 21 of 28) reported productivity costs. In nine, these took up more than 50 percent of total costs. In several studies, criminal justice and informal care costs were also important. Conclusions: There is great variety in the way the societal perspective is conceptualized and interpreted within economic evaluations. Use of the term ``societal perspective'' is often related to including merely productivity costs, while other ICBs could be relevant as well.},

This study focussed on decisions about the initial price and reimbursement status of innovative drugs and discussed the consequences for market access and cost. Four countries were studied: Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These countries have operated one, or both, of the two policies at certain points in time, sometimes in parallel. Drugs in four groups were considered: cholesterol-lowering agents, insulin analogues, biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and ``atypical'' drugs for schizophrenia. Compared with HTA, reference pricing is a relatively blunt instrument for obtaining value for money from pharmaceuticals. Thus, its role in making reimbursement decisions should be limited to drugs which are therapeutically equivalent. HTA is a superior strategy for obtaining value for money because it addresses not only price but also the appropriate indications for the use of the drug and the relation between additional value and additional costs. However, given the relatively higher costs of conducting HTAs, the most efficient approach might be a combination of both policies.},

The aim of this article was to provide a more detailed analysis of the characteristics of gene therapy and the extent to which these characteristics warrant modifications to the methods suggested in general reference cases for economic evaluation. We argue that a completely new reference case is not required, but propose a tailored checklist that can be used by analysts and decision makers to determine which aspects of economic evaluation should be considered further, given the unique nature of gene therapy.},

Intermediate- and high-risk patients were also randomly assigned after induction to receive or not receive six 5-day courses of nelarabine that was incorporated into ABFM. Patients who experienced induction failure were nonrandomly assigned to HDMTX plus nelarabine. Patients with overt CNS disease (CNS3; {$\geq$} 5 WBCs/{$\mu$}L with blasts) received HDMTX and were randomly assigned to receive or not receive nelarabine. All patients, except those with low-risk disease, received cranial irradiation.RESULTSThe 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 83.7\% {$\pm$} 1.1\% and 89.5\% {$\pm$} 0.9\%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for patients with T-ALL randomly assigned to nelarabine (n = 323) and no nelarabine (n = 336) were 88.2\% {$\pm$} 2.4\% and 82.1\% {$\pm$} 2.7\%, respectively (P = .029). Differences between DFS in a four-arm comparison were significant (P = .01), with no interactions between the MTX and nelarabine randomizations (P = .41). Patients treated with the best-performing arm, C-MTX plus nelarabine, had a 5-year DFS of 91\% (n = 147). Patients who received nelarabine had significantly fewer isolated and combined CNS relapses compared with patients who did not receive nelarabine (1.3\% {$\pm$} 0.63\% v 6.9\% {$\pm$} 1.4\%, respectively; P = .0001). Toxicities, including neurotoxicity, were acceptable and similar between all four arms.CONCLUSIONThe addition of nelarabine to ABFM therapy improved DFS for children and young adults with newly diagnosed T-ALL without increased toxicity.},

Study Design and Setting Sixty-four journals were hand searched at McMaster University. Methodologic criteria were applied to clinically relevant articles to identify ``pass'' and ``fail'' articles; 4,985 candidate terms were compiled, 7,463 combinations for therapy articles, and 5,246 combinations for reviews. Candidate search strategy results were compared with hand searches. The proposed strategies served as ``diagnostic tests'' for sound studies; the hand searches were the ``gold standard.'' Sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were calculated. Results Of 716 treatment articles, 233 (32.5\%) met criteria for scientific merit, and 58 (11.5\%) of 506 review articles met criteria for systematic reviews. For treatment studies, combined terms had a peak sensitivity of 97.9\% (specificity 52.2\%). Maximum specificity was 97.7\% (sensitivity 51.5\%). Sensitivity and specificity were each 79\% when optimizing both while minimizing their difference. For review articles, combined terms had a peak sensitivity of 81.0\% (specificity 54.4\%). Maximum specificity was 98.1\% (sensitivity 51.7\%). Sensitivity and specificity were each 65\% when optimizing both while minimizing their difference. Conclusions Empirically derived search strategies can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for retrieving sound treatment studies and review articles from PsycINFO.},

This approach allows approval to align more closely with patient needs for timely access to new technologies and for data to inform medical decisions. The concept of AL embraces a range of perspectives. Some see AL as an evolutionary step, extending elements that are now in place. Others envision a transformative framework that may require legislative action before implementation. This article summarizes recent AL proposals; discusses how proposals might be translated into practice, with illustrations in different therapeutic areas; and identifies unresolved issues to inform decisions on the design and implementation of AL.},

The present study is based on 131 persons who participated in the 28-month follow-up. Costs for the low vision clinic were documented prospectively along with external costs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was done using cases with an improved level of perceived security in daily activities as the effectiveness measure.Results: The Health Education Programme led to significantly more cases with an improved level of perceived security (45 vs. 10\%, CI 95\%: 21 \textendash{} 49, p value {$<$} 0.001) and the total social cost per treatment was lower (28 004 vs. 36 341 SEK). Taken separately the low vision clinic costs were slightly higher due to a higher prescription of assistive devices, but external costs were lower for the Health Education Programme compared to the Individual Programme, though neither of these differences was statistically significant.Conclusion: The results suggest that replacing the standard Individual Programme with the Health Education Programme `Discovering New Ways' is cost-effective as more persons experience increased security to a lesser total cost.},

  abstract = {The impact of advances in supportive care and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) practices on the outcomes of patients who develop grade III or IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of 427 patients with overall grade III or IV acute GVHD treated at 2 partner institutions between 1997 and 2012. We compared treatment-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) in 2 cohorts based on the year of transplantation, 1997 to 2006 (n~=~222) and 2007 to 2012 (n~=~205), using multivariate analysis, adjusting for significant patient-, disease-, and transplantation-related factors. Recipient age, reduced-intensity conditioning, unrelated donor, and peripheral blood stem cell grafts in the patients with grade III or IV acute GVHD increased over time. In the unadjusted analysis, 12-month OS increased over time (30\% in 1997 to 2006 versus 42\% in 2007 to 2012; P~=~.003) reflecting a decrease in TRM (58\% in 1997 to 2006 versus 38\% in 2007 to 2012; P~=~.0002), and an increase in PFS (29\% in 1997 to 2006 versus 43\% in 2007 to 2012; P~=~.002). On multivariate analysis, the period of transplantation remained a significant predictor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.94; P~=~.02), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 0.94; P~=~.02), and TRM (HR, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.82; P~=~.002). In subgroup analysis, these differences were observed mainly in patients with grade IV acute GVHD. The outcomes of patients who develop overall grade III or IV acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT has improved over time, with lower TRM and improved OS. This improvement in outcomes was seen primarily in patients with grade IV acute GVHD.},

First-line therapy for aGvHD still remains the use of high-dose corticosteroids. Unfortunately, 40\textendash 60\% of patients with aGvHD exhibit steroid resistance, which is associated with a very poor prognosis. As no effective second-line therapy existed, in recent decades various treatment options were considered for the treatment of therapy-refractory GvHD. Based on their in vitro immunomodulatory properties, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the treatment of aGvHD has been introduced. However, most of the clinical data are generated from uncontrolled trials and case series, showing clinical responses to MSCs. Clinical results are more consistent in children despite the use of MSC preparations of various provenance and manufacturing protocols. While these data support the therapeutic principle, the great variability of outcomes strongly suggests that not all MSC preparations are equal and that the specific manufacturing protocols influence therapeutic success in vivo.},

The Dutch government aspires to broaden the systematic application of full HTA towards other types of health care in order to optimise the content of the basic benefit package. This paper identifies important challenges for broadening the scope of full HTA to other types of health care. Based on a description of the Dutch reimbursement decision-making process, five important characteristics of outpatient pharmaceuticals were identified, which are all relevant to the successful application of HTA: (i) closed reimbursement system, (ii) absence of alternative policy measures, (iii) existence of marketing authorisation, (iv) identifiable and accountable counterparty, and (v) product characteristics. For a selection of other types of health care, which may be subject to HTA more frequently in the future, deviations from these characteristics of outpatient pharmaceuticals are discussed. The implications of such deviations for performing HTA and the decision-making process are highlighted. It is concluded that broadening the application of HTA will require policy makers to meet both important policy-related and methodological challenges. These challenges differ per health care domain, which may inform policy makers which expansions of the current use of HTA are most feasible.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) project is to develop a criteria list for assessment of the methodological quality of economic evaluations in systematic reviews. The criteria list resulting from this CHEC project should be regarded as a minimum standard. METHODS: The criteria list has been developed using a Delphi method. Three Delphi rounds were needed to reach consensus. Twenty-three international experts participated in the Delphi panel. RESULTS: The Delphi panel achieved consensus over a generic core set of items for the quality assessment of economic evaluations. Each item of the CHEC-list was formulated as a question that can be answered by yes or no. To standardize the interpretation of the list and facilitate its use, the project team also provided an operationalization of the criteria list items. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus among a group of international experts regarding a core set of items that can be used to assess the quality of economic evaluations in systematic reviews. Using this checklist will make future systematic reviews of economic evaluations more transparent, informative, and comparable. Consequently, researchers and policy-makers might use these systematic reviews more easily. The CHEC-list can be downloaded freely from http://www.beoz.unimaas.nl/chec/.},

HTA is a policy analysis that seeks to inform decision-makers in national, regional or hospital health services about the use of health technologies. HTAs require systematic processes that critically assess research about the impacts of using the health technology along with context-specific appraisal of the social, economic, legal and ethical implications of the use of the health technology. This is not simply a scientific endeavour. It requires interdisciplinary deliberative discussion and value judgements about the relevance of the evidence for the local health system. HTAs may recommend the use or disinvestment of a health technology and so are subject to political, public and stakeholder scrutiny. As a result there has been pressure to involve those who have a specific interest in the health technology, particularly patients, in the HTA process. However, this is contentious due to concerns about potential bias and representativeness of patient input and the scientific integrity of patient evidence.},

  abstract = {The persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during therapy is the strongest adverse prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We developed a high-throughput sequencing method that universally amplifies antigen-receptor gene segments and identifies all clonal gene rearrangements (ie, leukemia-specific sequences) at diagnosis, allowing monitoring of disease progression and clonal evolution during therapy. In the present study, the assay specifically detected 1 leukemic cell among greater than 1 million leukocytes in spike-in experiments. We compared this method with the gold-standard MRD assays multiparameter flow cytometry and allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) using diagnostic and follow-up samples from 106 patients with ALL. Sequencing detected MRD in all 28 samples shown to be positive by flow cytometry and in 35 of the 36 shown to be positive by ASO-PCR and revealed MRD in 10 and 3 additional samples that were negative by flow cytometry and ASO-PCR, respectively. We conclude that this new method allows monitoring of treatment response in ALL and other lymphoid malignancies with great sensitivity and precision.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although rituximab (R) is commonly used for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) requiring treatment, the optimal associated chemotherapy regimen has yet to be clarified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial among adult patients with previously untreated stages II to IV FL to compare efficacy of eight doses of R associated with eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) or six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone (FM). The principal end point of the study was time to treatment failure (TTF). RESULTS: There were 534 patients enrolled onto the study. Overall response rates were 88\%, 93\%, and 91\% for R-CVP, R-CHOP, and R-FM, respectively (P=.247). After a median follow-up of 34 months, 3-year TTFs were 46\%, 62\%, and 59\% for the respective treatment groups (R-CHOP v R-CVP, P=.003; R-FM v R-CVP, P=.006; R-FM v R-CHOP, P=.763). Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 52\%, 68\%, and 63\% (overall P=.011), respectively, and 3-year overall survival was 95\% for the whole series. R-FM resulted in higher rates of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (64\%) compared with R-CVP (28\%) and R-CHOP (50\%; P{$<$} .001). Overall, 23 second malignancies were registered during follow-up: four in R-CVP, five in R-CHOP, and 14 in R-FM. CONCLUSION: In this study, R-CHOP and R-FM were superior to R-CVP in terms of 3-year TTF and PFS. In addition, R-CHOP had a better risk-benefit ratio compared with R-FM.},

  abstract = {Objectives Losses to follow-up and administrative censoring can cloud the interpretation of trial-based economic evaluations. A number of investigators have examined the impact of different levels of adjustment for censoring, including nonadjustment, adjustment of effects only, and adjustment for both costs and effects. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research on the impact of censoring on decision-making. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of adjustment for censoring on the interpretation of cost-effectiveness results and expected value of perfect information (EVPI), using a trial-based analysis that compared rate- and rhythm-control treatments for persons with atrial fibrillation. Methods Three different levels of adjustment for censoring were examined: no censoring of cost and effects, censoring of effects only, and censoring of both costs and effects. In each case, bootstrapping was used to estimate the uncertainty incosts and effects, and the EVPI was calculated to determine the potential worth of further research. Results Censoring did not impact the adoption decision. Nevertheless, this was not the case for the decision uncertainty or the EVPI. For a threshold of \$50,000 per life-year, the EVPI varied between \$626,000 (partial censoring) to \$117 million (full censoring) for the eligible US population. Conclusions The level of adjustment for censoring in trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses can impact on the decisions to fund a new technology and to devote resources for further research. Only when censoring is taken into account for both costs and effects are these decisions appropriately addressed.},

  abstract = {Introduction Europe contains 9\% of the world population but has a 25\% share of the global cancer burden. Up-to-date cancer statistics in Europe are key to cancer planning. Cancer incidence and mortality estimates for 25 major cancers are presented for the 40 countries in the four United Nations-defined areas of Europe and for Europe and the European Union (EU-28) for 2018. Methods Estimates of national incidence and mortality rates for 2018 were based on statistical models applied to the most recently published data, with predictions obtained from recent trends, where possible. The estimated rates in 2018 were applied to the 2018 population estimates to obtain the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in Europe in 2018. Results There were an estimated 3.91 million new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.93 million deaths from cancer in Europe in 2018. The most common cancer sites were cancers of the female breast (523,000 cases), followed by colorectal (500,000), lung (470,000) and prostate cancer (450,000). These four cancers represent half of the overall burden of cancer in Europe. The most common causes of death from cancer were cancers of the lung (388,000 deaths), colorectal (243,000), breast (138,000) and pancreatic cancer (128,000). In the EU-28, the estimated number of new cases of cancer was approximately 1.6 million in males and 1.4 million in females, with 790,000 men and 620,000 women dying from the disease in the same year. Conclusion The present estimates of the cancer burden in Europe alongside a description of the profiles of common cancers at the national and regional level provide a basis for establishing priorities for cancer control actions across Europe. The estimates presented here are based on the recorded data from 145 population-based cancer registries in Europe. Their long established role in planning and evaluating national cancer plans on the continent should not be undervalued.},

This publication provides long-term follow-up data. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were monitored for a minimum of 5 years after completion of study treatment for the time-to-event end points of progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival per investigator assessment. Data on the number of patients who received second-line anticancer treatment and the occurrence of other malignancies were also collected. RESULTS The medians were not reached for any of the time-to event end points for either the BR or R-CHOP/R-CVP study treatment groups by study completion. PFS rates at 5 years were 65.5\% in the BR treatment group and 55.8\% in the R-CHOP/R-CVP group. The difference in PFS was considered significant with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.85; P = .0025). The hazard ratio for event-free survival and duration of response ( P = .0020 and .0134, respectively) also favored the BR regimen over R-CHOP/R-CVP. However, no significant difference in overall survival was observed. The overall safety profiles of BR, R-CHOP, and R-CVP were as expected; no new safety data were collected during long-term follow-up. A higher number of secondary malignancies was noted in the BR treatment group. CONCLUSION Overall, BR demonstrated better long-term disease control than R-CHOP/R-CVP and should be considered as a first-line treatment option for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Background Cost-utility analyses for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) require health state utility values (HSUVs) in order to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each health state. Aim This study reviewed AML-related HSUVs that could be used in economic evaluation studies. Materials and methods EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from January 2000 to November 2016 for relevant studies that reported quality of life (QoL) and HSUVs in AML. Identified relevant European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 values were mapped to HSUVs. HSUVs for each health state in the AML treatment pathway were then collated. Results Ten relevant studies were identified. Six were cost-effectiveness analyses utilizing HSUVs for calculation of QALYs, one was an effectiveness analysis (incremental QALY), and two were QoL studies reporting AML-specific utilities. An additional study reported QoL for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT). Since no study reported HSUVs for relapse, values from a study of secondary AML patients who failed prior treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome were used. Where multiple HSUVs were available, collected values were given priority over assumed values. AML treatment (induction, consolidation, or SCT) was associated with decreased HSUV, while post-treatment complete remission led to increased HSUV. Conclusion There are some methodologically robust HSUVs that can be directly used in economic evaluations for AML. Careful interpretation is advised considering significant differences in methodologies and patient population (inclusion, size). We need to develop HSUVs with larger-sized studies, making greater use of condition-specific data.},

  abstract = {Disease overview Follicular lymphoma is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly and less commonly other extranodal sites of involvement. In general, cytopenias can occur but constitutional symptoms of fever, nightsweats, and weight loss are uncommon. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on histology of preferably a biopsy of a lymph node. Immunohistochemical staining is positive in virtually all cases for cell surface CD19, CD20, CD10, and monoclonal immunoglobulin, as well as cytoplasmic expression of bcl-2 protein. The overwhelming majority of cases have the characteristic t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH/bcl-2 genes. Risk stratification The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index prognostic model for FL uses five independent predictors of inferior survival: age {$>$}60 years, hemoglobin {$<$}12 g/dL, serum LDH {$>$} normal, Ann Arbor stage III/IV, number of involved nodal areas {$>$} 4. The presence of 0, 1, 2, and {$\geq$} 3 adverse factors defines low, intermediate, and high-risk disease. With the use of more modern therapies, outcomes have improved. Risk-adapted therapy Observation continues to be adequate for asymptomatic patients with low bulk disease and no cytopenias, with no survival advantage for early treatment with either chemotherapy or rituximab alone. For patients needing therapy, most patients are treated with chemotherapy plus rituximab, which has improved response rates, duration of response and overall survival. Randomized studies have shown additional benefit for maintenance rituximab both following chemotherapy-rituximab and single agent rituximab. Experimental therapies as well as stem cell transplantation (SCT) are considered for recurrent disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to quantify the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and identify specific disabilities for remediation. PROCEDURE: Two types of subjects were included: ALL patients 5 plus years old in a multi-center clinical trial and general population control groups. Patients were assessed during all four major phases of active treatment and approximately 2 years after treatment. Health status and HRQL were measured using HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX\textregistered{} (HUI\textregistered ) Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3). HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Excess disability rates identified attributes for remediation. RESULTS: HUI assessments (n = 749) were collected during the five phases. Mean HRQL increased from induction through the post-treatment phase (P {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant demographic or treatment effects on HRQL, except for type of asparaginase during continuation therapy (P = 0.005 for HUI2 and P = 0.007 for HUI3). Differences in mean HRQL scores between patients and controls were important (P {$<$} 0.001) during the active treatment phases but not during the post-treatment phase. Relative to controls, patients lost approximately 0.2 QALYs during active treatment. Disability was evident in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care and pain, and declined over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL experienced important but declining deficits in HRQL during active treatment phases: Equivalent to losing approximately 2 months of life in perfect health. HRQL within the 2-years post-treatment phase was similar to controls. The policy challenge is to develop new treatment protocols producing fewer disabilities in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care, and pain without compromising survival.},

Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10\% to 40\%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

The control individuals had 78 boys (66\%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 102 boys (53\%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD \$470 013 (US \$357 031).

  abstract = {Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(CRBN) . T cell co-stimulation by lenalidomide or pomalidomide is cereblon dependent: however, the CRL4(CRBN) substrates responsible for T cell co-stimulation have yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that interaction of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1, encoded by the IKZF1 gene) and Aiolos (IKZF3, encoded by the IKZF3 gene) with CRL4(CRBN) is induced by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Each agent promotes Aiolos and Ikaros binding to CRL4(CRBN) with enhanced ubiquitination leading to cereblon-dependent proteosomal degradation in T lymphocytes. We confirm that Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors of interleukin-2 expression. The findings link lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-induced degradation of these transcriptional suppressors to well documented T cell activation. Importantly, Aiolos could serve as a proximal pharmacodynamic marker for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as healthy human subjects administered lenalidomide demonstrated Aiolos degradation in their peripheral T cells. In conclusion, we present a molecular model in which drug binding to cereblon results in the interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos to CRL4(CRBN) , leading to their ubiquitination, subsequent proteasomal degradation and T cell activation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Major guidelines regarding the application of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) have recommended the common and widespread use of the "societal perspective" for purposes of consistency and comparability. The objective of this Task Force subgroup report (one of six reports from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research [ISPOR] Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis [Drug Cost Task Force (DCTF)]) was to review the definition of this perspective, assess its specific application in measuring drug costs, identify any limitations in theory or practice, and make recommendations regarding potential improvements. METHODS: Key articles, books, and reports in the methodological literature were reviewed, summarized, and integrated into a draft review and report. This draft report was posted for review and comment by ISPOR membership. Numerous comments and suggestions were received, and the report was revised in response to them. RESULTS: The societal perspective can be defined by three conditions: 1) the inclusion of time costs, 2) the use of opportunity costs, and 3) the use of community preferences. In practice, very few, if any, published CEAs have met all of these conditions, though many claim to have taken a societal perspective. Branded drug costs have typically used actual acquisition cost rather than the much lower social opportunity costs that would reflect only short-run manufacturing and distribution costs. This practice is understandable, pragmatic, and useful to current decision-makers. Nevertheless, this use of CEA focuses on static rather than dynamic efficacy and overlooks the related incentives for innovation. CONCLUSIONS: Our key recommendation is that current CEA practice acknowledge and embrace this limitation by adopting a new standard for the reference case as one of a "limited societal" or "health systems" perspective, using acquisition drug prices while including indirect costs and community preferences. The field of pharmacoeconomics also needs to acknowledge the limitations of this perspective when it comes to important questions of research and development costs, and incentives for innovation.},

  abstract = {There is a significant and growing interest among both payers and producers of medical products for agreements that involve a ``pay-for-performance'' or ``risk-sharing'' element. These payment schemes\textemdash called ``performance-based risk-sharing arrangements'' (PBRSAs)\textemdash involve a plan by which the performance of the product is tracked in a defined patient population over a specified period of time and the amount or level of reimbursement is based on the health and cost outcomes achieved. There has always been considerable uncertainty at product launch about the ultimate real-world clinical and economic performance of new products, but this appears to have increased in recent years. PBRSAs represent one mechanism for reducing this uncertainty through greater investment in evidence collection while a technology is used within a health care system. The objective of this Task Force report was to set out the standards that should be applied to ``good practices''\textemdash both research and operational\textemdash in the use of a PBRSA, encompassing questions around the desirability, design, implementation, and evaluation of such an arrangement. This report provides practical recommendations for the development and application of state-of-the-art methods to be used when considering, using, or reviewing PBRSAs. Key findings and recommendations include the following. Additional evidence collection is costly, and there are numerous barriers to establishing viable and cost-effective PBRSAs: negotiation, monitoring, and evaluation costs can be substantial. For good research practice in PBRSAs, it is critical to match the appropriate study and research design to the uncertainties being addressed. Good governance processes are also essential. The information generated as part of PBRSAs has public good aspects, bringing ethical and professional obligations, which need to be considered from a policy perspective. The societal desirability of a particular PBRSA is fundamentally an issue as to whether the cost of additional data collection is justified by the benefits of improved resource allocation decisions afforded by the additional evidence generated and the accompanying reduction in uncertainty. The ex post evaluation of a PBRSA should, however, be a multidimensional exercise that assesses many aspects, including not only the impact on long-term cost-effectiveness and whether appropriate evidence was generated but also process indicators, such as whether and how the evidence was used in coverage or reimbursement decisions, whether budget and time were appropriate, and whether the governance arrangements worked well. There is an important gap in the literature of structured ex post evaluation of PBRSAs. As an innovation in and of themselves, PBRSAs should also be evaluated from a long-run societal perspective in terms of their impact on dynamic efficiency (eliciting the optimal amount of innovation).},

Demonstration of their real-world costs and cost-effectiveness is often required for reimbursement. However, few published economic evaluations of novel agents for multiple myeloma exist. Moreover, existing cost analyses were heavily based on conventionally treated patients. We investigated real-world health care costs of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in Dutch daily practice. Methods: A retrospective medical chart review was conducted for 139 patients treated between January 2001 and May 2009. Total monthly costs attributable to each cost component were described across all regimens and for bortezomib-, thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based treatment regimens. Results: Mean monthly total costs (\texteuro 3,981) varied depending on the sequence of therapy (range: \texteuro 442\textendash\texteuro 31,318). Significant cost drivers across all regimens included costs of therapy and hospital admissions. The acquisition costs for novel agents in particular accounted for 32\% of mean total monthly costs. Prognostic factors associated with increased mean total monthly costs in multivariate regression analysis included low platelet counts (P = 0{$\cdot$}01) and worsening performance status (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). Mean total monthly costs of bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens were significantly higher than those for thalidomide-based regimens in second, third and fourth treatment line. What is new and conclusions: Real-world costs during treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma vary greatly. Cost drivers include hospital admissions and acquisition costs of novel agents. Costs also vary by prognostic factors and treatment-related resource use. Future studies assessing the costs of combination therapy consisting of two or more novel agents are encouraged.},

Compared to bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens alone, the addition of high-dose melphalan followed by autologous transplantation significantly improves progression-free survival, although an overall survival benefit was not observed in all trials. Moreover, follow up of recent trials is still too short to show any difference in survival. In the light of these findings, novel agent-based induction followed by autologous transplantation is considered the standard upfront treatment for eligible patients (level of evidence: 1A). Post-transplant consolidation and maintenance treatment can further improve patient outcome (1A). The availability of several novel agents has led to the development of multiple combination regimens such as salvage treatment options. In this context, the role of salvage autologous transplantation and allotransplant has not been extensively evaluated. In the case of prolonged remission after upfront autologous transplantation, another autologous transplantation at relapse can be considered (2B). Patients who experience early relapse and/or have high-risk features have a poor prognosis and may be considered as candidates for clinical trials that, in young and fit patients, may also include an allograft in combination with novel agents (2B). Ongoing studies are evaluating the role of novel cellular therapies, such as inclusion of antibody-based triplets and quadruplets, and chimeric antigen receptor-T cells. Despite encouraging preliminary results, longer follow up and larger patient numbers are needed before the clinical use of these novel therapies can be widely recommended.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare conventional sibling bone marrow transplantation (CBMT), BMT with alternative donor (ABMT), and chemotherapy (CT) for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an early first marrow relapse.   Patients and Methods After informed consent, 214 patients with ALL and early marrow relapse began multiagent induction therapy. One hundred sixty-three patients with fewer than 25\% marrow blasts and count recovery at the end of induction (second remission [CR2]) were allocated by donor availability. Fifty patients with sibling donors were allocated to CBMT. Seventy-two patients were randomly allocated between ABMT and CT while 41 patients refused allocation.   Results Overall, 3-year event free survival from entry is 19\% {$\pm$} 3\%. Thirty-two of 50 CBMT patients (64\%) and 19 of 37 ABMT patients (51\%) underwent transplantation in CR2 with 3-year disease-free survival of 42\% {$\pm$} 7\% and 29\% {$\pm$} 7\%. The 3-year DFS is 29\% {$\pm$} 7\%, 21\% {$\pm$} 7\%, and 27\% {$\pm$} 8\% for patients allocated to CBMT, ABMT, and CT, respectively. Contrary to protocol, 12 of 35 patients allocated to CT underwent BMT in CR2. Of these, five patients died after BMT and 5 patients relapsed.   Conclusion More than one half of patients died, failed reinduction, or relapsed again before 3 months after CR2 (median time to BMT). Intent-to-treat pair-wise comparison of ABMT with CT, CT with CBMT, and CBMT with ABMT yields hazards of 1.2, 1.1, 0.8 with P values of .56, .80, and .36, respectively. Outcomes remain similar and poor for children with ALL and early marrow relapse. BMT is not a complete answer to the challenge of ALL and early marrow relapse.},

  abstract = {Background: In many countries, Budget Impact (BI) informs reimbursement decisions. Evidence has shown that decision-makers have restricted access based on high BI estimates but studies show that BI estimates are often inaccurate.Objective: To assess the accuracy of BI estimations used for informing access decisions on oncology drugs in the Netherlands.Study Design: Oncology products for which European Medicines Agency Marketing Authorisation was granted between 1-1-2000 and 1-10-2017 were selected. Observed BI data were provided by FarmInform. BI estimates were extracted from the reimbursement dossiers of the Dutch Healthcare Institute. Products without an estimated BI in the reimbursement dossier were excluded. Accuracy is defined as the ratio observed BI/estimated BI.Setting: General community, the Netherlands.Results: Ten products were included in the base case analysis. Mean accuracy was 0.64 and observed BI deviated by more than 40\% and 100\% from the estimated BI for 4 and 5 products, respectively. For all products together, \texteuro 141 million BI was estimated and \texteuro 82 million BI was observed, a \texteuro 59 million difference.Conclusions: The findings indicate that BI estimates for oncology drugs in the Netherlands are inaccurate. The role and use of BI in reimbursement decisions for these potentially life-saving drugs should therefore be considered carefully, as well as BI estimation methodology.},

The GEE approach focuses on models for the mean of the correlated observations within clusters without fully specifying the joint distribution of the observations. It has been widely used in statistical practice. This paper illustrates the application of the GEE approach with geepack through an example of clustered binary data.},

  abstract = {Using parametric models, a procedure for projecting survival estimates beyond the follow-up limits of a clinical trial is developed. The methodology consists of fitting an appropriate parametric model to the tail of a survival curve and using the estimated model in conjunction with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate to produce a composite survival-function estimator. This estimator is especially useful whenever a parametric model is more easily fit to the tail rather than to the entire survival curve. Probability plots are used to evaluate different parametric models as well as to determine appropriate values for the cut points that define the survival-function tail. The bootstrap method provides estimates of variation in the projected survival curve. The resulting projected survival estimates allow one to make inferences on long-term treatment effects in clinical trials. As a motivating application, we project survival curves to estimate long-term treatment effects on quality-of-life-adjusted survival. This represents an extension of a statistical procedure called Q-TWiST (Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity of treatment), which evaluates treatments in terms of both quantity and quality of life. In a standard Q-TWiST analysis, the average time spent in each of a number of health states, which differ in quality of life, is estimated from clinical trial data. The health states are weighted according to the quality of life experienced, and the results are combined to produce an estimate of quality-adjusted survival. Such estimates, however, are restricted to the follow-up limit of the data. The way in which the extrapolation methodology provides longer range estimates of Q-TWiST is described. To illustrate the techniques, we apply the methodology to data from the International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial V, which compares long-duration adjuvant chemotherapy versus short-duration chemotherapy in the treatment of node-positive breast cancer. Five-year median follow-up data are used to predict 10-year results in terms of mean survival and mean Q-TWiST. The results indicate that patients continue to benefit greatly from the long-duration chemotherapy between 5 and 10 years following treatment.},

Based on analyses of this new database, the existing seventh edition AJCC stage IV database, and contemporary clinical trial data, the AJCC Melanoma Expert Panel introduced several important changes to the Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) classification and stage grouping criteria. Key changes in the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include: 1) tumor thickness measurements to be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm, not 0.01 mm; 2) definitions of T1a and T1b are revised (T1a, {$<$}0.8 mm without ulceration; T1b, 0.8-1.0 mm with or without ulceration or {$<$}0.8 mm with ulceration), with mitotic rate no longer a T category criterion; 3) pathological (but not clinical) stage IA is revised to include T1b N0 M0 (formerly pathologic stage IB); 4) the N category descriptors ``microscopic'' and ``macroscopic'' for regional node metastasis are redefined as ``clinically occult'' and ``clinically apparent''; 5) prognostic stage III groupings are based on N category criteria and T category criteria (ie, primary tumor thickness and ulceration) and increased from 3 to 4 subgroups (stages IIIA-IIID); 6) definitions of N subcategories are revised, with the presence of microsatellites, satellites, or in-transit metastases now categorized as N1c, N2c, or N3c based on the number of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes, if any; 7) descriptors are added to each M1 subcategory designation for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (LDH elevation no longer upstages to M1c); and 8) a new M1d designation is added for central nervous system metastases. This evidence-based revision of the AJCC melanoma staging system will guide patient treatment, provide better prognostic estimates, and refine stratification of patients entering clinical trials.

  abstract = {PURPOSE Acalabrutinib, a highly selective, potent, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was evaluated in this global, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III study in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS Eligible patients, aged \$ 18 years with R/R CLL, were randomly assigned 1:1 centrally and stratified by del(17p) status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, and number of prior lines of therapy. Patients received acalabrutinib monotherapy or investigator's choice (idelalisib plus rituximab [I-R] or bendamustine plus rituximab [B-R]). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) in the intent-to-treat population. Key secondary end points included IRCassessed overall response rate, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS From February 21, 2017, to January 17, 2018, a total of 398 patients were assessed for eligibility; 310 patients were randomly assigned to acalabrutinib monotherapy (n 5 155) or investigator's choice (n 5 155; I-R, n 5 119; B-R, n 5 36). Patients had received a median of two prior therapies (range, 1-10). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months (range, 0.03-22.4 months), median PFS was significantly longer with acalabrutinib monotherapy (PFS not reached) compared with investigator's choice (16.5 months [95\% CI, 14.0 to 17.1 months]; hazard ratio, 0.31 [95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.49]; P , .0001). Estimated 12-month PFS was 88\% (95\% CI, 81\% to 92\%) for acalabrutinib and 68\% (95\% CI, 59\% to 75\%) for investigator's choice. Serious adverse events occurred in 29\% of patients (n 5 44 of 154) treated with acalabrutinib monotherapy, 56\% (n 5 66 of 118) with I-R, and 26\% (n 5 9 of 35) with B-R. Deaths occurred in 10\% (n 5 15 of 154), 11\% (n 5 13 of 118), and 14\% (n 5 5 of 35) of patients receiving acalabrutinib monotherapy, I-R, and B-R, respectively. CONCLUSION Acalabrutinib significantly improved PFS compared with I-R or B-R and has an acceptable safety profile in patients with R/R CLL.},

  abstract = {\textendash{} CLEAN VERSION Introduction: There are growing concerns among European health authorities regarding increasing prices for new cancer medicines, prices not necessarily linked to health gain and the implications for the sustainability of their healthcare systems. Areas covered: Narrative discussion principally among payers and their advisers regarding potential approaches to the pricing of new cancer medicines. Expert commentary: A number of potential pricing approaches are discussed including minimum effectiveness levels for new cancer medicines, managed entry agreements, multicriteria decision analyses (MCDAs), differential/tiered pricing, fair pricing models, amortization models as well as de-linkage models. We are likely to see a growth in alternative pricing deliberations in view of ongoing challenges including the considerable number of new cancer medicines in development including new gene therapies and being launched with uncertainty regarding their value, continued high prices coupled with the extent of confidential discounts for reimbursement; however, balanced against the need for new cancer medicines. This will lead to greater scrutiny over the prices of patent oncology medicines as more standard medicines lose their patent, calls for greater transparency as well as new models including amortization models. We will be monitoring these developments.},

  abstract = {Obinutuzumab (GA101) is a humanized, monoclonal type II CD20 antibody modified by glycoengineering. The glycoengineered Fc portion enhances the binding affinity to the FcgammaRIII receptor on immune effector cells, resulting in increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. In addition, the type II antibody binding characteristics of obinutuzumab to CD20 lead to an efficient induction of direct non-apoptotic cell death. Preclinical data demonstrated more efficient B-cell depletion in whole blood and superior antitumor activity in xenograft models of obinutuzumab as compared to the type I CD20 antibody rituximab. In previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and comorbidities, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival compared with rituximab plus chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab had an acceptable and manageable safety profile, with infusion-related reactions during the first infusion as the most common adverse event. Further phase I/II clinical trials have also shown promising activity in other CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Therefore, several clinical studies are planned or ongoing to investigate obinutuzumab with different combination partners in both untreated and relapsed/refractory patients with different B-cell NHL entities, which in addition to CLL include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

  abstract = {In a climate of escalating demands for new health care services and significant constraints on new resources, the disciplines of health economics and health technology assessment (HTA) have increasingly been turned to as explicit evidence-based frameworks to help make tough health care access and reimbursement decisions. Health economics is the discipline of economics concerned with the efficient allocation of health care resources, essentially trying to maximize health benefits to society contingent upon available resources. HTA is a broader field drawing upon several disciplines, but which relies heavily upon the tools of health economics and economic evaluation. Traditionally, health economics and economic evaluation have been widely used at the political (macro) and local (meso) decision-making levels, and have progressively had an important role even at informing individual clinical decisions (micro level). The aim of this paper is to introduce readers to health economics and discuss its relevance to frontline clinicians. Particularly, the content of the paper will facilitate clinicians' understanding of the link between economics and their medical practice, and how clinical decision-making reflects on health care resource allocation.},

  abstract = {Obinutuzumab (GA101) is a glycoengineered type 2 CD20 antibody with enhanced CD16A-binding and natural killer-mediated cytotoxicity. CD16B is highly homologous to CD16A and a major FcgammaR on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). We show here that glycoengineered obinutuzumab or rituximab bound CD16B with approximately sevenfold higher affinity, compared with nonglycoengineered wild-type parental antibodies. Furthermore, glycoengineered obinutuzumab activated PMNs, either purified or in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia whole blood, more efficiently than wild-type rituximab. Activation resulted in a 50\% increase in CD11b expression and 70\% down-modulation of CD62L on neutrophils and in release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Activation was not accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, but led to up to 47\% phagocytosis of glycoengineered anti-CD20 opsonized chronic lymphoblastic leukemia targets by purified PMNs. Significant phagocytosis was observed in whole blood, but only in the presence of glycoengineered antibodies, and was followed by up to 50\% PMN death. Finally we show, using anti-CD16B and anti-CD32A Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, that both of these receptors are involved in PMN activation, phagocytosis, and cell death induced by glycoengineered antibodies. We conclude that phagocytosis by PMNs is an additional mechanism of action of obinutuzumab mediated through its higher binding affinity for CD16B.},

  abstract = {Sickle cell disease (SCD) is common throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, affecting up to 3\% of births in some parts of the continent. Nevertheless, it remains a low priority for many health ministries. The most common form of SCD is caused by homozygosity for the {$\beta$}-globin S gene mutation (SS disease). It is widely believed that this condition is associated with very high child mortality, but reliable contemporary data are lacking. We have reviewed available African data on mortality associated with SS disease from published and unpublished sources, with an emphasis on two types of studies: cross-sectional population surveys and cohort studies. We have concluded that, although current data are inadequate to support definitive statements, they are consistent with an early-life mortality of 50\%\textendash 90\% among children born in Africa with SS disease. Inclusion of SCD interventions in child survival policies and programs in Africa could benefit from more precise estimates of numbers of deaths among children with SCD. A simple, representative, and affordable approach to estimate SCD child mortality is to test blood specimens already collected through large population surveys targeting conditions such as HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, and covering children of varying ages. Thus, although there is enough evidence to justify investments in screening, prophylaxis, and treatment for African children with SCD, better data are needed to estimate the numbers of child deaths preventable by such interventions and their cost effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: Estimates of life expectancy are a key input to cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) models for cancer treatments. Due to the limited follow-up in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), parametric models are frequently used to extrapolate survival outcomes beyond the RCT period. However, different parametric models that fit the RCT data equally well may generate highly divergent predictions of treatment-related gain in life expectancy. Here, we investigate the use of information external to the RCT data to inform model choice and estimation of life expectancy. Methods: We used Bayesian multi-parameter evidence synthesis to combine the RCT data with external information on general population survival, conditional survival from cancer registry databases, and expert opinion. We illustrate with a 5-year follow-up RCT of cetuximab plus radiotherapy v. radiotherapy alone for head and neck cancer. Results: Standard survival time distributions were insufficiently flexible to simultaneously fit both the RCT data and external data on general population survival. Using spline models, we were able to estimate a model that was consistent with the trial data and all external data. A model integrating all sources achieved an adequate fit and predicted a 4.7-month (95\% CrL: 0.4; 9.1) gain in life expectancy due to cetuximab. Conclusions: Long-term extrapolation using parametric models based on RCT data alone is highly unreliable and these models are unlikely to be consistent with external data. External data can be integrated with RCT data using spline models to enable long-term extrapolation. Conditional survival data could be used for many cancers and general population survival may have a role in other conditions. The use of external data should be guided by knowledge of natural history and treatment mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Aims: Obinutuzumab (GA101, G) was approved in February 2016 by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat follicular lymphoma (FL) patients who relapsed after, or are refractory to (R/R), a rituximab-containing regimen (R/R-rituximab). In the GADOLIN trial, R/R-rituximab patients who received G plus bendamustine (B) followed by G-monotherapy (G + B) for up to 2 years had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer perspective.Materials and methods: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area under the curve model including progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial's refractory FL progression-free and overall survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse events were based on trial data, and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty.Results: G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative to B-monotherapy of 1.24 (95\% CR = 0.61\textendash 1.87); the incremental total cost was \$58,100 (95\% CR = \$54,500\textendash\$61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \$47,000 per QALY gained, and, based on probabilistic simulations, there was a 98\% probability that G + B was cost-effective at the \$100,000 per QALY threshold.Limitations and conclusions: This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with G + B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis. However, the findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.},

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus R + chemo utilizing GALLIUM trial data and published literature. G + chemo had increased drug costs (undiscounted: \$135,200 versus \$127,700 for R + chemo), representing a relative increase of 5.9\%. However, this was offset by a \$6,400 lower cost for disease progression. G + chemo led to increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to R + chemo of 0.81 (95\% credible range, [CR]: 0.22\textendash 1.37), and the overall discounted incremental cost was \$1,900 (95\% CR: -\$7,400 to \$8,900).

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the benefit of maintenance rituximab therapy versus rituximab re-treatment at progression in patients with previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1998 and August 2002, 114 patients who had received previous chemotherapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with a standard 4-week course of rituximab. Patients with objective response or stable disease were randomly assigned to receive either maintenance rituximab therapy (standard 4-week courses administered at 6-month intervals) or rituximab re-treatment at the time of lymphoma progression. The duration of rituximab benefit was measured from the date of first rituximab treatment until the date other treatment was required. RESULTS: Ninety (79\%) of 114 patients had objective response or stable disease after initial rituximab treatment, and were randomly assigned to treatment. Progression-free survival was prolonged in the maintenance group (31.3 v 7.4 months; P = .007). Final overall and complete response rates were higher in the maintenance group. Duration of rituximab benefit was similar in the maintenance and re-treatment groups (31.3 v 27.4 months, respectively). More maintenance patients remain in continuous remission, and more are currently in complete remission. Both treatment approaches were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In patients who have objective response or stable disease with single-agent rituximab therapy, duration of rituximab benefit is substantially prolonged with either scheduled maintenance treatment or rituximab re-treatment at the time of progression. At present, the magnitude of benefit with either approach appears similar. However, additional follow-up of this trial is required, and completion of phase III randomized trials is necessary to definitively answer this question.},

We aimed to investigate the impact of using sources beyond PubMed in systematic reviews of therapeutic interventions. Study Design and Setting We randomly selected 50 Cochrane reviews that searched the PubMed (or MEDLINE) and EMBASE databases and included a meta-analysis of {$\geq$}10 studies. We checked whether each eligible record in each review (n~=~2,700) was retrievable in PubMed and EMBASE. For the first-listed meta-analysis of {$\geq$}10 studies in each review, we examined whether excluding studies not found in PubMed affected results. Results A median of one record per review was indexed in EMBASE but not in PubMed; a median of four records per review was not indexed in PubMed or EMBASE. Meta-analyses included a median of 13.5 studies; a median of zero studies per meta-analysis was indexed in EMBASE but not in PubMed; a median of one study per meta-analysis was not indexed in PubMed or EMBASE. Meta-analysis using only PubMed-indexed vs. all available studies led to a different conclusion in a single case (on the basis of conventional criteria for statistical significance). In meta-regression analyses, effects in PubMed- vs. non\textendash PubMed-indexed studies were statistically significantly different in a single data set. Conclusion For systematic reviews of the effects of therapeutic interventions, gains from searching sources beyond PubMed, and from searching EMBASE in particular are modest.},

  abstract = {Introduction: CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel) is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T)for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric/young adult patients (pts) with B-cellacute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL). Current treatments for r/r pediatric ALL (pALL) include clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), blinatumomab (Blin), other salvage chemotherapies (SC), and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). The prognosis for r/r pALL is poor and SCT is considered as the only potentially curative option. However, less than 50\% of pts with multiple relapses achieve CR from existing treatments, and even fewer are eligible for and ultimately receive SCT. CTL019 is a potentially promising treatment option for pALL pts with multiple relapses, with complete remission (CR) rates between 69-95\% based on data from phase I/II trials (ELIANA, ENSIGN, and CHP959). The current study aimed to compare the life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained using CTL019 vs. comparator treatments, and estimate the value-based prices for CTL019 at different incremental (incr) cost effectiveness ratios (willingness-to-pay [WTP] thresholds) for the treatment of r/r pALL from a US third-party payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model with monthly cycle and 3\% discount rate was developed to assess the incr cost effectiveness of CTL019 compared to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin, SC, and 2nd SCT, for the treatment of r/r pALL over a 20-year time horizon. The model included three health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease, and death. Efficacy inputs (overall survival [OS] and EFS) for CTL019 were based on pooled data of three phase I/II single-arm trials. Efficacy inputs for the comparators were based on publications of clinical trial and SCT registry that enrolled similar pts (although with notable differences); Kaplan-Meier curves of OS and EFS, where available, were used to reconstruct proxy patient-level data. Parametric models were fitted to extrapolate EFS and OS for each treatment until year 5. Afterwards, the model assumed no additional progression, and that all pts alive at 5 years would experience the same mortality risk consistent with long-term survivors of pALL. Pre-treatment (lymphodepleting for CTL019 and induction therapy for SCT) and treatment costs (drug, administration, and hospitalization), adverse event (AE) costs, subsequent SCT costs, and medical costs for each health state were obtained from public databases and literature. All costs were inflated to 2016 USD. Utilities for each health state and disutilities for AEs were based on literature. Incr LY, incr QALY, and incr cost per QALY gained were estimated comparing CTL019 to each comparator. Value-based prices, defined as the price that would achieve the incr cost effectiveness ratios (WTP thresholds) of \$100,000, \$150,000, \$200,000, and, \$300,000 per QALY gained, were calculated for CTL019 vs. each comparator. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Over a 20-year time horizon, treatment with CTL019 led to an increase of 4.62, 3.79, 3.68, 2.08 and 2.05 in discounted LYs and an increase of 4.29, 3.64, 3.64, 2.32 and 2.31 in discounted QALYs relative to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin, SC, and SCT respectively. CTL019 value prices to reach a specified incr cost effectiveness ratio (WTP threshold) of \$150,000/QALY ranged from \$604,289 to \$779,487 across comparators. The value prices ranged between \$951,745 and \$1,364,525 when the incr cost effectiveness ratio (WTP threshold) was set at \$300,000/QALY (Table 1). Results from the DSA generally supported the base case findings, with the largest variation observed when time horizon and the parametric survival functions were varied. Compared to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin and SC, CTL019 trials enrolled more severe pts who had failed more lines of prior therapies, which suggested that the estimated CTL019 LY and QALY benefits were conservative. Conclusions: Compared to existing treatments, CTL019 showed promisin efficacy results for the treatment of pediatric/young adult ALL pts, with incr QALY gains of 2.31-4.29. Using specified incr cost effectiveness ratios (WTP thresholds) from \$100,000/QALY to \$300,000/QALY, the valuebased prices for CTL019 ranged from \$488,470 to \$1,364,525. (Figure Presented).},

  abstract = {Introduction The efficacy of pharmaceuticals is most often demonstrated by randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, in some cases, regulatory applications lack RCT evidence. Objective To investigate the number and type of these approvals over the past 15 years by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Methods Drug approval data were downloaded from the EMA website and the `Drugs@FDA' database for all decisions on pharmaceuticals published from 1 January 1999 to 8 May 2014. The details of eligible applications were extracted, including the therapeutic area, type of approval and review period. Results Over the period of the study, 76 unique indications were granted without RCT results (44 by the EMA and 60 by the FDA), demonstrating that a substantial number of treatments reach the market without undergoing an RCT. The majority was for haematological malignancies (34), with the next most common areas being oncology (15) and metabolic conditions (15). Of the applications made to both agencies with a comparable data package, the FDA granted more approvals (43/44 vs 35/44) and took less time to review products (8.7 vs 15.5 months). Products reached the market first in the USA in 30 of 34 cases (mean 13.1 months) due to companies making FDA submission before EMA submissions and faster FDA review time. Discussion Despite the frequency with which approvals are granted without RCT results, there is no systematic monitoring of such treatments to confirm their effectiveness or consistency regarding when this form of evidence is appropriate. We recommend a more open debate on the role of marketing authorisations granted without RCT results, and the development of guidelines on what constitutes an acceptable data package for regulators.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground Different approaches can be adopted for the development of search strategies of systematic reviews. The objective approach draws on already established text analysis methods for developing search filters. Our aim was to determine whether the objective approach for the development of search strategies was noninferior to the conceptual approach commonly used in Cochrane reviews (CRs). Methods We conducted a search for CRs published in the Cochrane Library. The studies included in the CRs were searched for in MEDLINE and represented the total set. We then tested whether references previously removed could be identified via the objective approach. We also reconstructed the original search strategies from the CRs to determine why references could not be identified by the objective approach. As we performed the validation of the search strategies without study filters, we used only sensitivity as a quality measure and did not calculate precision. Results The objective approach yielded a mean sensitivity of 96\% based on 13 searches. The noninferiority test showed that this approach was noninferior to the conceptual approach used in the CRs (P~\&lt;~0.002). An additional descriptive analysis showed that the original MEDLINE strategies could identify only 86\% of all references; however, this lower sensitivity was largely due to one CR. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, our findings indicate for the first time that the objective approach for the development of search strategies is noninferior to the conceptual approach.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}The field of pharmacoeconomics (PE) faces serious concerns of research credibility and bias. The failure of researchers to reproduce similar results in similar settings, the inappropriate use of clinical data in economic models, the lack of transparency, and the inability of readers to make meaningful comparisons across published studies have greatly contributed to skepticism about the validity, reliability, and relevance of these studies to healthcare decision-makers. Using a case study in the field of lipid PE, two suggestions are presented for generally applicable reporting standards that will improve the credibility of PE. Health economists and researchers should be expected to provide either the software used to create their PE model or a multivariate sensitivity analysis of their PE model. Software distribution would allow other users to validate the assumptions and calculations of a particular model and apply it to their own circumstances. Multivariate sensitivity analysis can also be used to present results in a consistent and meaningful way that will facilitate comparisons across the PE literature. Using these methods, broader acceptance and application of PE results by policy-makers would become possible. To reduce the uncertainty about what is being accomplished with PE studies, it is recommended that these guidelines become requirements of both scientific journals and healthcare plan decision-makers. The standardization of economic modeling in this manner will increase the acceptability of pharmacoeconomics as a practical, real-world science.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Design: Analytic survey of operating characteristics of search strategies developed by computerized combinations of terms selected to detect studies meeting basic methodologic criteria for direct clinical use in adult general medicine. Measures: The sensitivities, specificities, precision, and accuracy of 134,264 unique combinations of search terms were determined by comparison with a manual review of all articles (the ``gold standard'') in ten internal medicine and general medicine journals for 1986 and 1991. Results: Less than half of the studies of the topics of interest met basic criteria for scientific merit for testing clinical applications. Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 82\% for sound studies of etiology, 92\% for prognosis, 92\% for diagnosis, and 99\% for therapy in 1991. Compared with the best single terms, multiple terms increased sensitivity for sound studies by over 30\% (absolute increase), but with some loss of specificity when sensitivity was maximized. For 1986, combinations reached peak sensitivities of 72\% for etiology, 95\% for prognosis, 86\% for diagnosis, and 98\% for therapy. When search terms were combined to maximize specificity, over 93\% specificity was achieved for all purpose categories in both years. Compared with individual terms, combined terms achieved near-perfect specificity that was maintained with modest increases insensitivity in all purpose categories except therapy. Increases in accuracy were achieved by combining terms for all purpose categories, with peak accuracies reaching over 90\% for therapy in 1986 and 1991. Conclusions: The retrieval of studies of important clinical topics cited in MEDLINE can be substantially enhanced by selected combinations of indexing terms and textwords.},

This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. This article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines. A panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences, conference presentations and a 2-day workshop. An internet survey of 716 journal editors, scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing. The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results and interpretation of findings. The SAGER guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts, but they are also useful for editors, as gatekeepers of science, to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process.},

These high prices raise concerns for patient access and the sustainability of healthcare systems. We aimed to estimate the costs and budget impact associated with CAR T-cell therapies for current and future indications in hematological cancers from 2019 to 2029. We focused on the former France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom (EU-5) and the Netherlands. We conducted a review of list prices, health technology assessment reports, budget impact analysis dossiers, and published cost-effectiveness analyses. We forecasted the 10-year health expenditures on CAR T-cells for several hematological cancers in selected European Union countries. Nine cost-effectiveness studies were identified and list prices for CAR T-cell therapies ranged between 307 200 EUR and 350 000 EUR. Estimated additional costs for pre- and post-treatment were 50 359 EUR per patient, whereas the incremental costs of CAR T-cell therapy (when compared with care as usual) ranged between 276 086 EUR and 328 727 EUR. We estimated market entry of CAR T-cell therapies for chronic mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia in 2021, 2022, 2022, 2022, and 2025, respectively. Cumulative expenditure estimates for existing and future indications from 2019 to 2029 were on average 28.5 billion EUR, 32.8 billion EUR, and 28.9 billion EUR when considering CAR T-cell therapy costs only, CAR T-cell therapy costs including pre- and post-treatment, and incremental CAR T-cell therapy costs, respectively. CAR T-cell therapies seem to be promising treatment options for hematological cancers but the financial burden on healthcare systems in the former EU-5 and the Netherlands will contribute to a substantial rise in healthcare expenditure in the field of hematology.},

  abstract = {Objective. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with high medical costs and especially with high productivity costs, in particular in patients in their working years. High molecular weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid (HA) is an alternative treatment for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, which are known for their serious side-effects. The cost-utility of intraarticular HMW-HA treatment in these patients is unknown, however, and was assessed in this study. Methods. Secondary care patients ages 18\textendash 65 years with knee OA were randomized to usual care plus HMW-HA (intervention group) or to usual care only (control group). A cost-utility analysis over 52 weeks from the societal and health care perspective was performed. Uncertainty for costs, effects, and cost-utility ratio was analyzed by nonparametric bootstrapping. Baseline imbalance adjustment was done by inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results. In total, 156 subjects were included (intervention group n = 77, control group n = 79). The total of productivity and medical costs was \texteuro 475 higher in the intervention group at \texteuro 7,754 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 5,426, 10,436) versus \texteuro 7,270 (95\% CI 5,453, 9,262). The amount of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during followup was also higher in the intervention group (0.779 versus 0.727). This variation resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \texteuro 9,100/ QALY from a societal perspective and \texteuro 8,700/QALY from a health care perspective. When the maximum willingness to pay for conditions similar to knee OA is considered, the probability on cost-effectiveness is 64\% and 86\%, respectively. Conclusion. Intraarticular HMW-HA added to usual care for knee OA is probably cost-effective in the treatment of knee OA. INTRODUCTION Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of OA. It results in high disability, high health care use, and high associated costs (1\textendash 3). The initial treatment for patients with knee OA consists of pain medication, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned a 'mock technology appraisal' to assess whether changes to its methods and processes are needed. This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal and the deliberations of a panel convened by NICE to evaluate the mock appraisal. METHODS: Our research included reviews to identify issues, analysis methods and conceptual differences and the relevance of alternative decision frameworks, alongside the development of an exemplar case study of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: An assessment of previous evaluations of regenerative medicines found that, although there were a number of evidential challenges, none was unique to regenerative medicines or was beyond the scope of existing methods used to conceptualise decision uncertainty. Regarding the clinical evidence for regenerative medicines, the issues were those associated with a limited evidence base but were not unique to regenerative medicines: small non-randomised studies, high variation in response and the intervention subject to continuing development. The relative treatment effects generated from single-arm trials are likely to be optimistic unless it is certain that the historical data have accurately estimated the efficacy of the control agent. Pivotal trials may use surrogate end points, which, on average, overestimate treatment effects. To reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta-analysis of all available data should be considered. Incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (more mature) data into the analysis can also be considered; such data may become available as a result of the evolving regulatory pathways being developed by the European Medicines Agency. For the exemplar case of CAR T-cell therapy, target product profiles (TPPs) were developed, which considered the 'curative' and 'bridging to stem-cell transplantation' treatment approaches separately. Within each TPP, three 'hypothetical' evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and mature) were generated to simulate the impact of alternative levels of precision and maturity in the clinical evidence. Subsequent assessments of cost-effectiveness were undertaken, employing the existing NICE reference case alongside additional analyses suggested within alternative frameworks. The additional exploratory analyses were undertaken to demonstrate how assessments of cost-effectiveness and uncertainty could be impacted by alternative managed entry agreements (MEAs), including price discounts, performance-related schemes and technology leasing. The panel deliberated on the range of TPPs, evidence sets and MEAs, commenting on the likely recommendations for each scenario. The panel discussed the challenges associated with the exemplar and regenerative medicines more broadly, focusing on the need for a robust quantification of the level of uncertainty in the cost-effective estimates and the potential value of MEAs in limiting the exposure of the NHS to high upfront costs and loss associated with a wrong decision. CONCLUSIONS: It is to be expected that there will be a significant level of uncertainty in determining the clinical effectiveness of regenerative medicines and their long-term costs and benefits, but the existing methods available to estimate the implications of this uncertainty are sufficient. The use of risk sharing and MEAs between the NHS and manufacturers of regenerative medicines should be investigated further.

The efficacy and safety of intravenous clofarabine 40 mg/m2 per day, cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m2 per day, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days in pediatric patients with R/R ALL was evaluated in this phase 2 study. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (complete remission [CR] plus CR without platelet recovery [CRp]). Among the 25 patients (median age, 14 years; pre-B cell ALL, 84\%; {$\geq$} 2 prior regimens: 84\%; refractory to previous regimen: 60\%), the overall response rate was 44\% (7 CR, 4 CRp) with a 67.3-week median duration or remission censored at last follow-up. Most patients proceeded to alternative therapy, and 10 patients (40\%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Six patients (24\%) died because of treatment-related adverse events associated with infection, hepatotoxicity, and/or multiorgan failure. The study protocol was amended to exclude patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after 4 of the first 8 patients developed severe hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease. No additional cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred. The regimen offered encouraging response rates and sustained remission in R/R patients. Future investigation should include exploration of patient selection, dosing, and supportive care. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00315705.},

Main outcome measures Content of a sample of records and doctor recall of consultations for which paperless or paper based records had been made. Results Compared with paper based records, more paperless records were fully understandable (89.2\% v 69.9\%, P=0.0001) and fully legible (100\% v 64.3\%, P {$<$} 0.0001). Paperless records were significantly more likely to have at least one diagnosis recorded (48.2\% v 33.2\%, P=0.05), to record that advice had been given (23.7\% vs 10.7\%, P=0.017), and, when a referral had been made, were more likely to contain details of the specialty (77.4\% v 59.5\%, P=0.03). When a prescription had been issued, paperless records were more likely to specify the drug dose (86.6\% v 66.2\%, P=0.005). Paperless records contained significantly more words, abbreviations, and symbols (P {$<$} 0.01 for all). At doctor interview, there was no difference between the groups for the proportion of patients or consultations that could be recalled. Doctors using paperless records were able to recall more advice given to patients (38.6\% v 26.8\%, P=0.03). Conclusion We found no evidence to support our hypotheses that paperless records would be truncated and contain more local abbreviations; and that the absence of writing would decrease subsequent recall. Conversely we found that the paperless records compared favourably with manual records.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thalidomide and bortezomib have been frequently used for second-line therapy in patients with myeloma relapsing after or refractory to initial melphalan-based treatment, but no randomized trials have been published comparing these two treatment alternatives. METHODS: Thalidomide- and bortezomib-na\"ive patients with melphalan refractory myeloma were randomly assigned to low-dose thalidomide + dexamethasone (Thal-Dex) or bortezomib + dexamethasone (Bort-Dex). At progression on either therapy, the patients were offered crossover to the alternative drug combination. An estimated 300 patients would be needed for the trial to detect a 50\% difference in median PFS between the treatment arms. RESULTS: After inclusion of 131 patients, the trial was prematurely closed because of low accrual. Sixty-seven patients were randomized to Thal-Dex and 64 to Bort-Dex. Progression-free survival was similar (median, 9.0 months for Thal-Dex and 7.2 for Bort-Dex). Response rate was similar (55\% for Thal-Dex and 63\% for Bort-Dex), but time to response was shorter (P {$<$} 0.05) and the VGPR rate higher (P {$<$} 0.01) for Bort-Dex. Time-to-other treatment after crossover was similar (median, 13.2 months for Thal-Dex and 11.2 months for Bort-Dex), as was overall survival (22.8 months for Thal-Dex and 19.0 for Bort-Dex). Venous thromboembolism was seen in seven patients and cerebrovascular events in four patients in the Thal-Dex group. Severe neuropathy, reactivation of herpes virus infections, and mental depression were more frequently observed in the Bort-Dex group. In the quality-of-life analysis, no difference was noted for physical function, pain, and global quality of life. Fatigue and sleep disturbances were significantly more prevalent in the Bort-Dex group. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide (50-100 mg daily) in combination with dexamethasone seems to have an efficacy comparable with that of bortezomib and dexamethasone in melphalan refractory myeloma. However, the statistical strength of the results in this study is limited by the low number of included patients.},

Up-to-date evidence on the total cost of cancer is needed to inform policy decisions. This study estimates the cost of cancer in Europe in 2018 and extends a previous analysis for 1995\textendash 2014. Methods Cancer-specific health expenditure were derived from national estimates. Data on cancer drug sales were obtained from IQVIA. The productivity loss from premature mortality was estimated from data from Eurostat and the World Health Organization. Estimates of the productivity loss from morbidity and informal care costs were based on previous studies. Findings The total cost of cancer was \texteuro 199 billion in Europe (EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) in 2018. Total costs ranged from \texteuro 160 per capita in Romania to \texteuro 578 in Switzerland (after adjustment for price differentials). Health expenditure on cancer care were \texteuro 103 billion, of which \texteuro 32 billion were spent on cancer drugs. Informal care costs were \texteuro 26 billion. The total productivity loss was \texteuro 70 billion, composed of \texteuro 50 billion from premature mortality and \texteuro 20 billion from morbidity. Interpretation Health expenditure on cancer care were of a similar magnitude as the sum of non-health-care costs in 2018. Over the last two decades, health spending on cancer has increased faster than the increase in cancer incidence. The productivity loss from premature mortality has decreased because of reductions in mortality in the working-age population. Trends in informal care costs and productivity loss from morbidity are uncertain because of lack of comparable data.},

Until now mainly intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been used in Germany, and the majority of patients receive treatment in hospital outpatient clinics. In recent years subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins (SCIG) has been developed which is administered as home self-infusion. Studies indicate no significant differences in immunoglobulin substitution therapy between SCIG and IVIG concerning outcome. We carried out a cost-minimization analysis to compare the two treatment alternatives in Germany. Under base case assumptions the treatment with SCIG is cost saving from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. The main cost drivers are IVIG and SCIG; the incremental cost of SCIG compared to IVIG is most sensitive to changes in the immunoglobulin price and changes in the body weight of the patient.},

A cost-effectiveness analysis of R-maintenance versus observation was conducted from a US payer perspective to estimate PFS and overall survival (OS) over a representative patient's lifetime. Primary outcomes were cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with observation, R-maintenance increased mean PFS by 1.50 years, OS by 1.21 years and QALYs gained by 1.11 years. The incremental cost of maintenance therapy was \$38 545. The costs per LYG and QALY gained were \$31 934 and \$34 842, respectively. Within the limitations of modeling long-term outcomes, R-maintenance therapy in patients who received R-chemo for previously untreated f-NHL compared with observation alone after R-chemo for first-line treatment for f-NHL is cost-effective from the US payer perspective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of childhood cancer often results in an altered life situation for the parents, characterized by difficulties regarding work, family and household demands. Previous research shows that parents' work situation and income are impacted, yet, few studies have explored the issue from a longitudinal perspective. This study sought to increase the knowledge about the socio-economic conditions of parents of children with cancer in Sweden by means of a longitudinal assessment of work situation, sick leave, and household income. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of mothers (n = 139) and fathers (n = 138) of children with cancer recruited from 2002 to 2004. Data was collected by telephone interviews at six time points, ranging from the time of diagnosis to one year after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Findings showed that parents' work situation was most evidently impacted during the child's treatment, when the greatest proportions of non-working and sick-listed parents were found. Compared with the time of diagnosis, fewer mothers worked up to three months after the end of treatment, and more mothers were on sick leave one year after the end of treatment. Although the extent of sick leave among fathers did not differ compared with the time of diagnosis, fewer fathers worked one year after the end of treatment. Household income was significantly reduced during the child's treatment and months thereafter, while income was at an equal level as before the diagnosis for most families one year after the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: The results offer a unique understanding of how mothers' and fathers' work situation and income are impacted in the short- and long-term, and give guidance on how to improve the comprehensive support given to parents of children with cancer. Socio-economical issues should be emphasized as these may provide targets for policy interventions aiming to reduce parental strain related to work and finances.},

Instead, it is common to fit curves to summary Kaplan-Meier graphs, either by regression or by least squares.

Together, these elements comprise a PICO frame. Although this framework was developed to facilitate the formulation of clinical queries, the ability of PICO structures to represent physicians' information needs has not been empirically investigated. This paper evaluates the adequacy and suitability of PICO frames as a knowledge representation by analyzing 59 real-world primary-care clinical questions. We discovered that only two questions in our corpus contain all four PICO elements, and that 37\% of questions contain both intervention and outcome. Our study reveals prevalent structural patterns for the four types of clinical questions: therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. We found that the PICO framework is primarily centered on therapy questions, and is less suitable for representing other types of clinical information needs. Challenges in mapping natural language questions into PICO structures are also discussed. Although we point out limitations of the PICO framework, our work as a whole reaffirms its value as a tool to assist physicians practicing EBM.},

  abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation. Population average models typically use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic regression approaches because the health of residents in the same neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper, we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed models involve unverifiable assumptions on the data-generating distribution, which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference. We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average models provides a more useful approximation of the truth.},

When using vague information sources, it is particularly important to plan, analyze, and report the information processing in a standardized and transparent way. Our objective was to search and analyze recommendations regarding where and how to include expert data in HTA. METHODS: We performed a systematic database search and screened the Internet pages of seventy-seven HTA organizations for guidelines, recommendations, and methods papers that address the inclusion of experts in HTA. Relevant documents were downloaded, and information was extracted in a standard form. Results were merged in tables and narrative evidence synthesis. RESULTS: From twenty-two HTA organizations, we included forty-two documents that consider the use of expert opinion in HTA. Nearly all documents mention experts in the step of preparation of the evidence report. Six documents address their role for priority setting of topics, fifteen for scoping, twelve for the appraisal of evidence and results, another twelve documents mention experts when considering the dissemination of HTA results. During the assessment step, experts are most often asked to amend the literature search or to provide expertise for special data analyses. Another issue for external experts is to appraise the HTA results and refer them back to a clinical and social context. Little is reported on methods of expert elicitation when their input substitutes study data. CONCLUSIONS: Despite existing recommendations on the use of expert opinion in HTA, common standards for elicitation are scarce in HTA guidelines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Economic evaluations of health interventions pose a particular challenge for reporting because substantial information must be conveyed to allow scrutiny of study findings. Despite a growth in published reports, existing reporting guidelines are not widely adopted. There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user-friendly manner. A checklist is one way to help authors, editors, and peer reviewers use guidelines to improve reporting. OBJECTIVE: The task force's overall goal was to provide recommendations to optimize the reporting of health economic evaluations. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines into one current, useful reporting guidance. The CHEERS Elaboration and Explanation Report of the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices Task Force facilitates the use of the CHEERS statement by providing examples and explanations for each recommendation. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. METHODS: The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. Previously published checklists or guidance documents related to reporting economic evaluations were identified from a systematic review and subsequent survey of task force members. A list of possible items from these efforts was created. A two-round, modified Delphi Panel with representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, and government, as well as the editorial community, was used to identify a minimum set of items important for reporting from the larger list. RESULTS: Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed, with some specific recommendations for single study-based and model-based economic evaluations. The final recommendations are subdivided into six main categories: 1) title and abstract, 2) introduction, 3) methods, 4) results, 5) discussion, and 6) other. The recommendations are contained in the CHEERS statement, a user-friendly 24-item checklist. The task force report provides explanation and elaboration, as well as an example for each recommendation. The ISPOR CHEERS statement is available online via Value in Health or the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices - CHEERS Task Force webpage (http://www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). CONCLUSIONS: We hope that the ISPOR CHEERS statement and the accompanying task force report guidance will lead to more consistent and transparent reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate wider dissemination and uptake of this guidance, we are copublishing the CHEERS statement across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups to consider endorsing the CHEERS statement. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in 5 years.},

Systematic reviews identify, select, assess, and synthesize the findings of similar but separate studies, and can help clarify what is known and not known about the potential benefits and harms of drugs, devices, and other healthcare services. Systematic reviews can be helpful for clinicians who want to integrate research findings into their daily practices, for patients to make well-informed choices about their own care, for professional medical societies and other organizations that develop clinical practice guidelines. Too often systematic reviews are of uncertain or poor quality. There are no universally accepted standards for developing systematic reviews leading to variability in how conflicts of interest and biases are handled, how evidence is appraised, and the overall scientific rigor of the process. In Finding What Works in Health Care the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends 21 standards for developing high-quality systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research. The standards address the entire systematic review process from the initial steps of formulating the topic and building the review team to producing a detailed final report that synthesizes what the evidence shows and where knowledge gaps remain. Finding What Works in Health Care also proposes a framework for improving the quality of the science underpinning systematic reviews. This book will serve as a vital resource for both sponsors and producers of systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research.},

Treatment options for relapsed iNHL include chemotherapy {$\pm$} rituximab and rituximab monotherapy. Lenalidomide plus rituximab (R2) is an immunomodulatory regimen that enhances rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity and improves clinical activity in iNHL. AUGMENT was a double-blind phase III randomized trial of R2 vs. rituximab + placebo (R-placebo) in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma who were not refractory to rituximab. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Data reported here focus on Japanese patients from AUGMENT and reflect 36 patients (n = 18, each group). PFS was superior in the R2 group, HR = 0.32 (95\% CI 0.11\textendash 0.96). Median PFS was not reached (95\% CI 19.7\textendash NE) in the R2 group vs. 16.5 months (95\% CI 11.3\textendash 30.6) in the R-placebo group. Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent in patients treated with R2 (67\%) than with R-placebo (22\%), primarily attributable to increased neutropenia (50\% vs 17\%). R2 resulted in significantly longer median PFS than R-placebo in Japanese patients with R/R iNHL, and the efficacy and the safety profile of R2 were similar to those reported in the global population.},

Specifically, the focus is on methods that combine shorter-term individual-level survival data from randomized trials with longer-term external data, thus using the longer-term data to aid extrapolation of the short-term data. This requires assumptions about how trends in survival for each treatment arm will continue after the follow-up period of the trial. Furthermore, using external data requires assumptions about how survival differs between the populations represented by the trial and external data. Study reports from a national health technology assessment program in the United Kingdom were searched, and the findings were combined with "pearl-growing" searches of the academic literature. We categorized the methods that have been used according to the assumptions they made about how the hazards of death vary between the external and internal data and through time, and we discuss the appropriateness of the assumptions in different circumstances. Modeling choices, parameter estimation, and characterization of uncertainty are discussed, and some suggestions for future research priorities in this area are given.},

  abstract = {Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. About 35\%\textendash 50\% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients will develop acute GVHD. The exact risk is dependent on the stem cell source, age of the patient, conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis used. Given the number of transplants performed, we can expect about 5500 patients/year to develop acute GVHD. Patients can have involvement of three organs: skin (rash/dermatitis), liver (hepatitis/jaundice), and gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain/diarrhea). One or more organs may be involved. GVHD is a clinical diagnosis that may be supported with appropriate biopsies. The reason to pursue a tissue biopsy is to help differentiate from other diagnoses which may mimic GVHD, such as viral infection (hepatitis, colitis) or drug reaction (causing skin rash). Acute GVHD is staged and graded (grade 0-IV) by the number and extent of organ involvement. Patients with grade III/IV acute GVHD tend to have a poor outcome. Generally the patient is treated by optimizing their immunosuppression and adding methylprednisolone. About 50\% of patients will have a solid response to methylprednisolone. If patients progress after 3 days or are not improved after 7 days, they will get salvage (second-line) immunosuppressive therapy for which there is currently no standard-of-care. Well-organized clinical trials are imperative to better define second-line therapies for this disease. Additional management issues are attention to wound infections in skin GVHD and fluid/nutrition management in gastrointestinal GVHD. About 50\% of patients with acute GVHD will eventually have manifestations of chronic GVHD.},

Patients and Methods In a phase II, open-label, multicenter study, 61 pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours daily for 5 days, every 2 to 6 weeks. The median age was 12 years (range, 1 to 20 years), and the median number of prior regimens was three (range, two to six regimens).   Results The response rate was 30\%, consisting of seven complete remissions (CR), five CRs without platelet recovery (CRp), and six partial remissions. Remissions were durable enough to allow patients to proceed to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) after clofarabine. Median CR duration in patients who did not receive HSCT was 6 weeks, with four patients maintaining CR or CRp for 8 weeks or more (8+, 12, 37+, and 48 weeks) on clofarabine therapy alone. The most common adverse events of grade {$\geq$} 3 were febrile neutropenia, anorexia, hypotension, and nausea.   Conclusion Clofarabine is active as a single agent in pediatric patients with multiple relapsed or refractory ALL. The toxicity profile is as expected in this heavily pretreated patient population. Studies exploring rational combinations of clofarabine with other agents are ongoing in an effort to maximize clinical benefit.},

A multicenter seamless design pivotal phase 1 trial of liso-cel in R/R B-NHL (NCT02631044) has enrolled; long-term follow up of the nonpivotal cohort will be presented here. Methods: Pts with R/R DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B, or MCL and adequate organ function are eligible. Treatment includes lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by liso-cel. Multiple dose levels (DLs) and administration schedules were evaluated; DL2 (108 CAR T cells) was chosen for the pivotal cohort. The nonpivotal FULL dataset includes all pts in the DLBCL cohort (DLBCL NOS, PMBCL, FL3B) treated with liso-cel at all DLs; CORE dataset includes only pts meeting inclusion criteria for the pivotal cohort, including DLBCL NOS (de novo or transformed from FL) and high grade lymphoma. Study objectives include safety, PK, and antitumor response. Results: As of Oct 9, 2017, 91 pts were treated and evaluable for safety, 88 for efficacy. Pt characteristics were previously reported (Abramson ASH 2017). CRS was seen in 35\% of pts; a single pt (1\%) developed grade 3-4 CRS. Neurotoxicity (NT) developed in 19\% of pts including 12\% grade 3-4; all but one event resolved at time of data snapshot. Median onset of CRS and NT was 5 and 10 days respectively. Nineteen pts (21\%) received tocilizumab and/or dexamethasone. Long term safety, including B cell aplasia, infections, and cytopenias, will be reported. Best ORR in FULL and CORE was 74\% (65/88) and 80\% (52/65), respectively; best CR was 52\% (46/88) in FULL and 55\% (36/65) in CORE. A higher rate of durable response at DL2 was observed in the CORE population, with 6-month ORR and CR of 50\% and 50\% (7/14) vs 40\% (8/20) and 30\% (6/20) at DL1. Long term efficacy, including 6-/12-month follow up from \textasciitilde 95/\textasciitilde 55 pts, will be reported. Conclusions: Liso-cel shows durable responses in pts with heavily pretreated R/R DLBCL and trends toward more durable responses at DL2. Observed acute toxicities have been manageable at all DLs tested and long-term safety from the nonpivotal cohort will be reported. Clinical trial information: NCT02631044.},

We hypothesized that extending DAPT from 12 months to 30 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after DES is cost-effective. A lifelong decision-analytic model was designed to simulate 2 antiplatelet strategies in event-free ACS patients who had completed 12-month DAPT after DES: aspirin monotherapy (75\textendash 162 mg daily) and continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus aspirin 75\textendash 162 mg daily) for 18 months. Clinical event rates, direct medical costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were the primary outcomes from the US healthcare provider perspective. Base-case results showed DAPT continuation gained higher QALYs (8.1769 vs 8.1582 QALYs) at lower cost (USD42 982 vs USD44 063). One-way sensitivity analysis found that base-case QALYs were sensitive to odds ratio (OR) of cardiovascular death with DAPT continuation and base-case cost was sensitive to OR of nonfatal stroke with DAPT continuation. DAPT continuation remained cost-effective when the ORs of nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular death were below 1.241 and 1.188, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, DAPT continuation was the preferred strategy in 74.75\% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations at willingness-to-pay threshold of 50 000 USD/QALYs. Continuation of DAPT appears to be cost-effective in ACS patients who were event-free for 12-month DAPT after DES. The cost-effectiveness of DAPT for 30 months was highly subject to the OR of nonfatal stroke and OR of death with DAPT continuation.},

We evaluated their cost effectiveness.METHODSWe used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.RESULTSIn an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40\% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at \$129,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$90,000 to \$219,000). At a 30\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive (\$159,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35\% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at \$168,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$414,000/QALY).

  abstract = {PURPOSETwo anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel; each costs \$373,000. We evaluated their cost effectiveness.METHODSWe used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.RESULTSIn an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40\% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at \$129,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$90,000 to \$219,000). At a 30\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive (\$159,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35\% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at \$168,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$414,000/QALY). At a 25\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive (\$223,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$123,000 to \$1,170,000/QALY]).

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine outcome of treatment for patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twelve newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma patients were studied. One hundred seventy-nine were initially treated successfully. Recurrent or progressive lymphoma developed in 116. Treatment was given according to disease stage and current protocols, mostly with single alkylating agents. A policy of repeated lymph node and bone marrow biopsy was pursued. RESULTS: The overall median survival duration was 9 years, with a median follow-up duration of 12 years. Following recurrence, the median survival duration was 4 1/2 years. Only eight of 116 patients with recurrent disease died of causes unrelated to lymphoma. The overall response rate to first re-treatment was 78\% and showed slight decline with successive recurrences, reaching 48\% after the fourth treatment. The median duration of second remission was 13 months, (v 31 months for first remission), with the only significant predictive factor being quality of remission. Multivariate analysis showed only age at recurrence and number of prior treatments to correlate with survival after first recurrence. Survival after second remission was only correlated with age and quality of response: Kaplan-Meier estimates gave 53\% of patients reaching second complete remission alive 10 years later, compared with 28\% in partial remission. CONCLUSION: Age and previous and continuing responsiveness of follicular lymphoma to therapy are the principal determinants of survival following recurrence. Improvement in survival with new treatments will be demonstrated most readily in older patients, while more intensive approaches should be tested in younger patients in whom remission is achieved with difficulty.},

  abstract = {Objective. To examine resource utilization and direct healthcare cost associated with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression among patients with prevalent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on analyses of retrospective healthcare claims data. Methods. The index date was set as the first observed claim with an RA diagnosis. Patients were required to be {$\geq$} 18 years of age, to have received RA-related treatment during the pre-index period, and to have 12-month pre- and post-index data. Based on pre-index utilization, patients were classified into 4 diagnosis groups: RA alone, RA + CVD, RA + depression, and RA + CVD + depression. Analyses focused on annual differences in costs between patients with RA alone and those with CVD and/or depression. A generalized linear model was applied to control for demographic and clinical characteristics and to estimate cohort-specific adjusted mean annual healthcare cost. Results. Of 10,298 patients, 8,916 had RA alone (86.6\%), 608 had RA + CVD (5.9\%), 716 had RA + depression (7.0\%), and 58 had RA + CVD + depression (0.5\%). All patients with CVD and/or depression incurred significantly higher followup costs compared with patients with RA alone. Adjusted annual mean healthcare costs were highest for RA + CVD (US\$14,145), followed by RA + CVD + depression (\$13,513), RA + depression (\$12,225), and RA alone (\$11,404). Although patients with CVD and/or depression had a greater rate of RA-related hospitalization, adjusted RA-related healthcare costs did not reflect any statistically significant differences as compared to the RA-alone cohort. Conclusion. A significant proportion (13.4\%) of patients with prevalent RA have comorbid CVD and/or depression. The presence of these conditions significantly affects annual healthcare costs as well as specific RA-related utilization patterns.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The approval of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, revolutionized the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and became an undisputed standard of care. However, as with all biologic medicines, the complex development and manufacturing process for rituximab have meant that the medicine attracts high treatment costs. Approved rituximab biosimilars have been comprehensively demonstrated to match the reference medicine. With the potential to increase access to biologic therapy, they have a key role in helping to improve patient outcomes in lymphoma care.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of rituximab in the treatment of lymphoma. We explore development and regulatory requirements for biosimilar development and the potential impact of these medicines on access and sustainability. Focusing on biosimilars of rituximab, we examine in detail the evidence for biosimilarity for the two rituximab biosimilars that are approved in Europe and provide an overview of rituximab biosimilars currently in development.Expert opinion: We foresee a wider uptake of biosimilar medicines for lymphoma treatment over the next 5 years. The associated cost savings should be invested in broadening patient access to biological therapies, enabling wider use of more expensive treatment strategies and driving innovation in cancer care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) single technology appraisal (STA) process, independent Evidence Review Groups (ERGs) critically appraise the company submission. During the critical appraisal process the ERG may undertake analyses to explore uncertainties around the company's model and their implications for decision-making. The ERG reports are a central component of the evidence considered by the NICE Technology Appraisal Committees (ACs) in their deliberations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to develop an understanding of the number and type of exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERGs within the STA process and to understand how these analyses are used by the NICE ACs in their decision-making. METHODS: The 100 most recently completed STAs with published guidance were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The documents considered were ERG reports, clarification letters, the first appraisal consultation document and the final appraisal determination. Over 400 documents were assessed in this study. The categories of types of exploratory analyses included fixing errors, fixing violations, addressing matters of judgement and the ERG-preferred base case. A content analysis of documents (documentary analysis) was undertaken to identify and extract relevant data, and narrative synthesis was then used to rationalise and present these data. RESULTS: The level and type of detail in ERG reports and clarification letters varied considerably. The vast majority (93\%) of ERG reports reported one or more exploratory analyses. The most frequently reported type of analysis in these 93 ERG reports related to the category 'matters of judgement', which was reported in 83 (89\%) reports. The category 'ERG base-case/preferred analysis' was reported in 45 (48\%) reports, the category 'fixing errors' was reported in 33 (35\%) reports and the category 'fixing violations' was reported in 17 (18\%) reports. The exploratory analyses performed were the result of issues raised by an ERG in its critique of the submitted economic evidence. These analyses had more influence on recommendations earlier in the STA process than later on in the process. LIMITATIONS: The descriptions of analyses undertaken were often highly specific to a particular STA and could be inconsistent across ERG reports and thus difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence Review Groups frequently conduct exploratory analyses to test or improve the economic evaluations submitted by companies as part of the STA process. ERG exploratory analyses often have an influence on the recommendations produced by the ACs. FUTURE WORK: More in-depth analysis is needed to understand how ERGs make decisions regarding which exploratory analyses should be undertaken. More research is also needed to fully understand which types of exploratory analyses are most useful to ACs in their decision-making.

  abstract = {Summary The financial crisis in Europe has posed major threats and opportunities to health. We trace the origins of the economic crisis in Europe and the responses of governments, examine the effect on health systems, and review the effects of previous economic downturns on health to predict the likely consequences for the present. We then compare our predictions with available evidence for the effects of the crisis on health. Whereas immediate rises in suicides and falls in road traffic deaths were anticipated, other consequences, such as HIV outbreaks, were not, and are better understood as products of state retrenchment. Greece, Spain, and Portugal adopted strict fiscal austerity; their economies continue to recede and strain on their health-care systems is growing. Suicides and outbreaks of infectious diseases are becoming more common in these countries, and budget cuts have restricted access to health care. By contrast, Iceland rejected austerity through a popular vote, and the financial crisis seems to have had few or no discernible effects on health. Although there are many potentially confounding differences between countries, our analysis suggests that, although recessions pose risks to health, the interaction of fiscal austerity with economic shocks and weak social protection is what ultimately seems to escalate health and social crises in Europe. Policy decisions about how to respond to economic crises have pronounced and unintended effects on public health, yet public health voices have remained largely silent during the economic crisis.},

Using publicly available data, we estimated mild, moderate, and severe anemia from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries, both sexes, and 20 age groups. We then performed cause-specific attribution to 17 conditions using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) 2010 Study. Global anemia prevalence in 2010 was 32.9\%, causing 68.36 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 40.98 to 107.54) million years lived with disability (8.8\% of total for all conditions [95\% UI, 6.3\% to 11.7\%]). Prevalence dropped for both sexes from 1990 to 2010, although more for males. Prevalence in females was higher in most regions and age groups. South Asia and Central, West, and East sub-Saharan Africa had the highest burden, while East, Southeast, and South Asia saw the greatest reductions. Iron-deficiency anemia was the top cause globally, although 10 different conditions were among the top 3 in regional rankings. Malaria, schistosomiasis, and chronic kidney disease-related anemia were the only conditions to increase in prevalence. Hemoglobinopathies made significant contributions in most populations. Burden was highest in children under age 5, the only age groups with negative trends from 1990 to 2010.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rituximab has significantly improved the prognosis for patients with both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An economic evaluation was carried out to assess the cost-effectiveness in Sweden of rituximab as maintenance therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma in remission after second line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incremental cost and effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation were evaluated in a health-state transition model. Primary effect measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and life-years gained (LYG). Model state transitions were calculated based on progression-free and overall survival data from the EORTC20981 trial. The analysis was made from the perspective of the healthcare provider, including direct medical costs presented in euro, 2007 value. Effects and costs were discounted at a 3\% annual rate. The stability of the base case results were tested in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The evaluation assessed rituximab maintenance therapy to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro 12,600 and an incremental cost per LYG of euro 11,200. The average discounted life expectancy for patients on rituximab maintenance was 1.0 year longer than for patients on observation (5.96 vs. 4.94 years). Rituximab maintenance was associated with an additional 0.9 QALY, and total costs per patient were euro 11,500 higher in the treatment arm, compared to observation. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that rituximab maintenance treatment after successful induction therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in Sweden is cost-effective compared to observation.},

  abstract = {PurposeThe MURANO study demonstrated significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit for fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With all patients off treatment, we report minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics and updated outcomes.MethodsPatients were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax plus rituximab during the first six cycles, or six cycles of bendamustine-rituximab. Primary end point was PFS. Safety and peripheral blood (PB) MRD status\textemdash at cycle 4, 2 to 3 months after end of combination therapy (EOCT), and every 3 to 6 months thereafter\textemdash were secondary end points.ResultsOf 194 patients, 174 (90\%) completed the venetoclax-rituximab phase and 130 (67\%) completed 2 years of venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 36 months, PFS and overall survival remain superior to bendamustine-rituximab (hazard ratio, 0.16 [95\% CI, 0.12 to 0.23]; and hazard ratio, 0.50 [95\% CI, 0.30 to 0.85], respectively). Patients who received venetoclax-rituximab achieved a higher rate of PB undetectable MRD (uMRD; less than 10-4) at EOCT (62\% v 13\%) with superiority sustained through month 24 (end of therapy). Overall, uMRD status at EOCT predicted longer PFS. Among those with detectable MRD, low-level MRD (10-4 to less than 10-2) predicted improved PFS compared with high-level MRD (10-2 or greater). At a median of 9.9 months (range, 1.4 to 22.5 months) after completing fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab, overall only 12\% (16 of 130) of patients developed disease progression (11 high-level MRD, three low-level MRD). At the end of therapy, 70\% and 98\% of patients with uMRD remained in uMRD and without disease progression, respectively.ConclusionWith all patients having finished treatment, continued benefit was observed for venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab. uMRD rates were durable and predicted longer PFS, which establishes the impact of PB MRD on the benefit of fixed-duration, venetoclax-containing treatment. Low conversion to detectable MRD and sustained PFS after completion of 2 years of venetoclax-rituximab demonstrate the feasibility of this regimen.},

Study endpoints included safety of Prochymal administration, induction of response to Prochymal, and overall response of aGVHD by day 28, and long-term safety. Thirty-two patients were enrolled, with 31 evaluable: 21 males, 10 females; median age 52 years (range: 34-67). Twenty-one patients had grade II, 8 had grade III, and 3 had grade IV aGVHD. Ninety-four percent of patients had an initial response to Prochymal (77\% complete response [CR] and 16\% partial response [PR]). No infusional toxicities or ectopic tissue formations were reported. There was no difference with respect to safety or efficacy between the low and high Prochymal dose. In conclusion, Prochymal can be infused safely into patients with aGVHD and induces response in a high proportion of GVHD patients.},

We conducted a multicenter, randomized study to assess the efficacy of using ex vivo cultured adult human MSC (remestemcel-L) in addition to second-line therapy to treat steroid-refractory aGVHD (NCT00366145). In total, 260 patients, 6 months to 70 years of age, were enrolled from August 2006 to May 2009 and were randomized 2:1 to receive 8 intravenous infusions of remestemcel-L or placebo, given over 4 weeks, in addition to second-line therapy according to institutional standards. Four additional infusions over 4 weeks were indicated for patients with incomplete response at day 28. Randomization was stratified by aGVHD grade. Efficacy and safety were assessed through 180 days of follow-up, with the primary endpoint being durable complete response (DCR), defined as complete resolution of aGVHD symptoms for any period of at least 28 days after beginning treatment. Remestemcel-L did not meet the primary endpoint of greater DCR in the intent-to-treat population (35\% versus 30\%; P = 0.42). In post hoc analyses, patients with liver involvement who received at least 1 infusion of remestemcel-L had a higher DCR, and higher overall complete or partial response rate (OR) than those who received placebo (29\% versus 5\%; P = .047). Among high-risk patients (aGVHD grades C and D), remestemcel-L demonstrated significantly higher OR at day 28 than placebo (58\% versus 37\%; P = 0.03). Furthermore, pediatric patients had a higher OR with MSCs compared with placebo (64\% versus 23\%; P = .05). Similar rates of adverse events were observed between treatment groups. Remestemcel-L was safe and well tolerated. Results of this study did not demonstrate superior DCR compared with placebo when added to standard of care. The favorable clinical responses seen in some patient subsets may warrant further investigation.},

Because significant efforts have been made to improve clinical trial enrollment for AYAs, we (1) present contemporary clinical trial enrollment rates by cancer type, sociodemographic characteristics, and treatment setting and (2) discuss provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers to clinical trial participation. Contemporary studies examining clinical trial enrollment among AYAs have continued to find low overall participation relative to pediatric populations, with most studies observing no significant improvements in enrollment over time. In addition to age and cancer type, enrollment varies by treatment setting, health insurance, and race/ethnicity. Access to available clinical trials may be increased by appropriate referral of AYAs to pediatric and adult specialty cancer centers with studies relevant to the AYA population because most AYAs are treated in the community setting. Even with similar access to trials, however, AYAs may be less likely to participate, and therefore, future efforts should focus on better understanding and addressing barriers to enrollment as well as improving education and outreach regarding clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted under idealized and rigorously controlled conditions that may compromise their external validity. A literature review was conducted of published English language articles that reported the findings of studies assessing external validity by a comparison of the patient sample included in RCTs reporting on pharmaceutical interventions with patients from everyday clinical practice. The review focused on publications in the fields of cardiology, mental health, and oncology. A range of databases were interrogated (MEDLINE; EMBASE; Science Citation Index; Cochrane Methodology Register). Double-abstract review and data extraction were performed as per protocol specifications. Out of 5,456 de-duplicated abstracts, 52 studies met the inclusion criteria (cardiology, n\,=\,20; mental health, n\,=\,17; oncology, n\,=\,15). Studies either performed an analysis of the baseline characteristics (demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical parameters) of RCT-enrolled patients compared with a real-world population, or assessed the proportion of real-world patients who would have been eligible for RCT inclusion following the application of RCT inclusion/exclusion criteria. Many of the included studies concluded that RCT samples are highly selected and have a lower risk profile than real-world populations, with the frequent exclusion of elderly patients and patients with co-morbidities. Calculation of ineligibility rates in individual studies showed that a high proportion of the general disease population was often excluded from trials. The majority of studies (n\,=\,37 [71.2~\%]) explicitly concluded that RCT samples were not broadly representative of real-world patients and that this may limit the external validity of the RCT. Authors made a number of recommendations to improve external validity. Findings from this review indicate that there is a need to improve the external validity of RCTs such that physicians treating patients in real-world settings have the appropriate evidence on which to base their clinical decisions. This goal could be achieved by trial design modification to include a more representative patient sample and by supplementing RCT evidence with data generated from observational studies. In general, a thoughtful approach to clinical evidence generation is required in which the trade-offs between internal and external validity are considered in a holistic and balanced manner.},

On average, each year, 15 000 new cases of FL are diagnosed in the United States alone. Despite dramatic improvements worldwide in the treatment of FL, such as the emergence of anti-CD20 agents, FL cannot be cured yet. There is no widely agreed standard of care for the first line therapy of FL. Current options include ``watch and wait'' strategies, rituximab monotherapy, multi-drug therapy of rituximab and bendamustine or CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisones), or combinations with the new anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab. Even with average of 80\% response rate to initial therapy 20\% of patients relapse within 2 years and there is no clear consensus on further management. However, a diverse set of new drugs with different mechanisms of action are available in a relapse setting. These drugs have extended overall survival (OS) up to 12 years. An indolent course of FL is manifested by varying periods of remissions and relapses that can potentially progress to transformation into either other hematologic malignancy (eg, DLBCL) or become chemo-refractory. Considering the chronic nature of FL, physicians should strive for both efficacy of treatment and possible extended-length remissions, and for good patient quality of life and limited toxicity.},

Validation of these models is recommended as an indicator of reliability, but is not commonly reported. Furthermore, models derived from different data and employing different assumptions may produce a variety of results.A Markov model for evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm is described. Internal, prospective and external validations are carried out using individual participant data from two randomised trials. Validation is assessed in terms of total numbers and timings of key events, and total costs and life-years. Since the initial model validates well only internally, two further models are developed that better fit the prospective and external validation data. All three models are then extrapolated to a life-time horizon, producing cost-effectiveness estimates ranging from pound1600 to pound4200 per life-year gained.Parameter uncertainty is now commonly addressed in health economic decision modelling. However, the derivation of models from different data sources adds another level of uncertainty. This extra uncertainty should be recognised in practical decision-making and, where possible, specifically investigated through independent model validation.},

An important element in many non-expected utility theories is the probability weighting function (PWF), that nonlinearly weights physical probabilities. Using US market price data, we attempt to establish an empirical relation between investors' mood and these PWFs. To proxy investors' mood, we rely on an established medical phenomenon, seasonal affective disorder, a source of depression caused by the scarcity of daylight time during fall and winter, as well as on a measure of cloudiness. We find statistical evidence indicating that bad mood causes investors to systematically distort their PWFs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite improvements in treatment, approximately 20\% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experience relapse and do poorly. The Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia (TACL) Consortium was assembled to assess novel drugs for children with resistant leukemia. We hypothesize that novel agents and combinations that fail to improve baseline complete remission rates in comparable populations are unlikely to contribute to better outcomes and should be abandoned. We sought to define response rates and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in patients treated at TACL institutions, which could serve as a comparator for future studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients with relapsed and refractory ALL previously treated at TACL institutions between the years of 1995 and 2004. Data regarding initial and relapsed disease characteristics, disease response, and survival were collected and compared with those of published reports. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) rates (mean +/- SE) were 83\% +/- 4\% for early first marrow relapse, 93\% +/- 3\% for late first marrow relapse, 44\% +/- 5\% for second marrow relapse, and 27\% +/- 6\% for third marrow relapse. Five-year DFS rates in CR2 and CR3 were 27\% +/- 4\% and 15\% +/- 7\% respectively. CONCLUSION: We generally confirm a 40\% CR rate for second and subsequent relapse, but our remission rate for early first relapse seems better than that reported in the literature (83\% v approximately 70\%). Our data may allow useful modeling of an expected remission rate for any population of patients who experience relapse.},

Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and DIMDI to identify empirical and methodological articles focusing on health insurance claims data studies published between 2000 and 2014. Inclusion criteria were (1) English/German full text articles or chapters in edited books that (2) focused on the claims data of statutory health insurance funds. Findings In total, 435 articles were included. Over time, the number of claims data studies has increased strongly and the frequency of policy-relevant research types increased. Along with the historical improvement path of claims data in Germany, we observed a rising percentage of international publications and an increase in the average quality of publications. In contrast to the US or Canada where comprehensive databases have been established, the most common data source in this search was data from a single SHI fund, while databases were rarely used. Conclusions Claims data are an important source of information for healthcare stakeholders, and their use for research purposes has further increased during recent years in Germany. Despite its potential in optimising the health system, we found a lack of German comprehensive all-payer claims databases compared to the US and Canada.},

  abstract = {Despite risk-adapted treatment, survival of children with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor compared with that of patients with initial diagnosis of ALL. Leukemia-associated genetic alterations may provide novel prognostic factors to refine present relapse treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of 13 recurrent genetic alterations in 204 children treated uniformly for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. The most common alterations were deletions of CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, fusion of ETV6-RUNX1 and deletions and/or mutations of TP53. Multivariate analysis identified IKZF1 deletion and TP53 alteration as independent predictors of inferior outcome (P=0.002 and P=0.001). Next, we investigated how both alterations can improve the established risk stratification in relapsed ALL. Intermediate-risk relapse patients with low minimal residual disease are currently considered to have a good prognosis. In this group, deletion of IKZF1 and alteration of TP53 identify patients with significantly inferior outcome (P{$<$}0.001). In high-risk relapse patients, deletion of IKZF1 is strongly predictive of a second relapse after stem cell transplantation (P{$<$}0.001). We conclude that IKZF1 and TP53 represent relevant prognostic factors that should be considered in future risk assessment of children with relapsed ALL to indicate treatment intensification or intervention.},

Because microsimulation models are computationally more demanding than traditional Markov cohort models, the use of computer programming languages in their development has become more common. R is a programming language that has gained recognition within the field of decision modeling. It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models. We also show how this code can be extended to address more complex model structures and provide an efficient microsimulation approach that relies on vectorization solutions.},

The cohort trace is the primary outcome of cSTMs, which captures the proportion of the cohort in each health state over time (state occupancy). However, the cohort trace is an aggregated measure that does not capture information about the specific transitions among health states (transition dynamics). In practice, these transition dynamics are crucial in many applications, such as incorporating transition rewards or computing various epidemiological outcomes that could be used for model calibration and validation (e.g., disease incidence and lifetime risk). In this article, we propose an alternative approach to compute and store cSTMs outcomes that capture both state occupancy and transition dynamics. This approach produces a multidimensional array from which both the state occupancy and the transition dynamics can be recovered. We highlight the advantages of the multidimensional array over the traditional cohort trace and provide potential applications of the proposed approach with an example coded in R to facilitate the implementation of our method.},

  abstract = {Productivity costs occur when the productivity of individuals is affected by illness, treatment, disability or premature death. The objective of this paper was to review past and current developments related to the inclusion, identification, measurement and valuation of productivity costs in economic evaluations. The main debates in the theory and practice of economic evaluations of health technologies described in this review have centred on the questions of whether and how to include productivity costs, especially productivity costs related to paid work. The past few decades have seen important progress in this area. There are important sources of productivity costs other than absenteeism (e.g. presenteeism and multiplier effects in co-workers), but their exact influence on costs remains unclear. Different measurement instruments have been developed over the years, but which instrument provides the most accurate estimates has not been established. Several valuation approaches have been proposed. While empirical research suggests that productivity costs are best included in the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio, the jury is still out regarding whether the human capital approach or the friction cost approach is the most appropriate valuation method to do so. Despite the progress and the substantial amount of scientific research, a consensus has not been reached on either the inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations or the methods used to produce productivity cost estimates. Such a lack of consensus has likely contributed to ignoring productivity costs in actual economic evaluations and is reflected in variations in national health economic guidelines. Further research is needed to lessen the controversy regarding the estimation of health-related productivity costs. More standardization would increase the comparability and credibility of economic evaluations taking a societal perspective.},

The objectives were to characterize pediatric CUAs, appraise their quality, and identify determinants of higher quality. METHODS: Descriptive data were imported from the PEDE database for 305 pediatric CUAs published from 1997 to 2009, and quality was rated using the Pediatric Quality Appraisal Questionnaire (PQAQ) in 213 studies. The impact on quality of publication year, journal type, and whether utility was measured was analyzed using multiple regression. RESULTS: CUAs increased over time and the largest proportion was from North America (38\%). Children aged 1-12~years (39\%) and preventative interventions (51\%) were studied most frequently. Whereas a societal perspective was most common in papers published before 2007 (49\%), a third-party payer perspective was subsequently most frequent (63\%). Utility was measured prospectively in 8\% of studies. Domains that demonstrated the poorest quality were Perspective, Costs and resource use, Outcomes, Analysis, Incremental analysis and Conflict of interest. Quality increased significantly over time for most domains and was greater in studies published in methods/health economic journals. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of pediatric CUAs is increasing. Few studies ascertain utility prospectively, suggesting the need for better instruments for pediatric health state valuation and measurement.},

The primary end-point was time to progression. Results In the intent-to-treat population (N=499), the median time to progression was 6.1, 7.0, 7.6, and 9.1 months in patients treated with dexamethasone, and thalidomide 100, 200, and 400 mg/day, respectively; the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant. In the per-protocol population (n=465), the median time to progression was 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.1 months, respectively. In patients who had received two or three prior therapies, thalidomide significantly prolonged the time to progression at all dose levels compared to the result achieved with dexamethasone. Response rates and median survival were similar in all treatment groups, but the median duration of response was significantly longer in all thalidomide groups than in the dexamethasone group. Adverse events reported in the thalidomide groups, such as fatigue, constipation and neuropathy, confirmed the known safety profile of thalidomide. Conclusions Although thalidomide was not superior to dexamethasone in this randomized trial, thalidomide monotherapy may be considered an effective salvage therapy option for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, particularly those with a good prognosis and those who have received two or three prior therapies.

  abstract = {This phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled study aimed to evaluate the benefit of adding continuous low-dose oral cyclophosphamide to bortezomib-dexamethasone in patients with primary relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive up to eight 3-week cycles of bortezomib (1.3~mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20~mg; VD; n~=~48) or bortezomib-dexamethasone plus oral cyclophosphamide (50~mg; VCD; n~=~48). Median time to progression (primary endpoint) was slightly longer in the VD versus VCD group (12.6 vs 9.9~months, P~=~0.192), and the hazard ratio for disease progression was in favor of VD (hazard ratio~=~0.71, 95\% confidence interval~=~0.43\textendash 1.19, P~=~0.196). The overall response rate was 74\% with VD and 70\% with VCD. Most adverse events were similar in frequency between arms; however, grade~{$\geq~$}3 peripheral neuropathy was more frequent in the VCD versus VD arm (15 vs 4\%). Infection rate was higher in the VCD arm (64 vs 52\%); however, grade {$\geq$}3 infection rates were comparable (19 vs 17\%). Further trials are needed to determine whether addition of cyclophosphamide to VD at a different dose/schedule confers clinical benefit. This study was terminated prematurely, with insufficient sample size to adequately compare the arms; the results should, therefore, be considered descriptive.

  abstract = {Background The epidemiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) in Germany is currently changing fundamentally with ongoing immigration. Here, we address the challenges resulting from the increased frequency, that is, the morbidity, and mortality of SCD in this population. Procedure The number of immigrants with SCD was estimated based on the data of the German central registry of migrants (2007\textendash 2015) and published epidemiologic data. Additional data analysis was based on nationwide aggregated data from the diagnosis-related groups' (DRG) statistics of the German Federal Statistical Office. Results The total number of patients with SCD among migrants was estimated at 2,016 in 2007 and 3,216 in 2015, thus showing a 60\% increase, which was particularly remarkable during 2014 and 2015. The countries of origin included those of West sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Syria, and other countries of the Middle East. In parallel, the number of SCD inpatient treatments increased from 780 in 2002 to 1,340 in 2015. Between 2012 and 2014, 42 patients with SCD died in hospital, mostly at an age of less than 5 years (n = 7) or over 30 years (n = 29). Conclusion More than 3,000 patients with SCD are estimated to live among the immigrant population in Germany. In addition, the number of SCD patients of German nationality is not known. The increasing number of inpatient treatments and the death of young children from SCD indicate the need for a general newborn screening program and an increased awareness of this disease among medical practitioners in a country in which SCD used to be rare.},

  abstract = {Steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (SR-aGVHD) following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Currently, there are no safe and effective therapies approved for use in the pediatric population under the age of 12 years. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new treatments that are safe, well tolerated, and effective in managing this debilitating and potentially fatal complication of HSCT. In early phase clinical trials, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute GVHD (aGVHD) in pediatric patients. We now report the results of a phase 3, prospective, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT02336230) in 54 children with primary SR-aGVHD who were naive to other immunosuppressant therapies for aGVHD treated with MSC product (remestemcel-L) dosed at 2~\texttimes ~106 cells/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks. Remestemcel-L therapy significantly improved day 28 overall response rate (OR) compared with the prespecified control OR value of 45\% (70.4\% versus 45\%, P~=~.0003). The statistically significant OR (70.4\%) was sustained through day 100, including an increase in complete response from 29.6\% at day 28 to 44.4\% at day 100. Overall survival was 74.1\% at day 100 and 68.5\% at day 180. Overall response in all participants at day 28 was highly predictive of improved survival through 180 days, and survival was significantly greater in day 28 responders compared with nonresponders through day 100 (86.8\% versus 47.1\% for responders and nonresponders, respectively, P~=~.0001) and through day 180 (78.9\% versus 43.8\%, P~=~.003). Remestemcel-L was well tolerated with no identified infusion-related toxicities or other safety concerns. This study provides robust, prospective evidence of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of remestemcel-L as first-line therapy after initial steroid failure in pediatric SR-aGVHD.},

  abstract = {Background. A common feature of most reviews or catalogues of health utilities has been their focus on adult health states or derivation of values from adult populations. More generally, utility measurement in or on behalf of children has been constrained by several methodological concerns. The objective of this study was to conduct the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of primary utility data for childhood conditions and descriptors, and to determine the effects of methodological factors on childhood utilities. Methods. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EconLit, CINAHL and Cochrane Library were searched for primary studies reporting health utilities for childhood conditions or descriptors using direct or indirect valuation methods. The Paediatric Economic Database Evaluation (PEDE) Porject was also searched for cost-utility analyses with primary utility values. Mean or median utilities for each of the main samples were catalogued, and weighted averages of utilities for each health condition were estimated, by valuation method. Mixed-effects meta-regression using hierarchical linear modeling was conducted for the most common valuation methods to estimate the utility decrement for each health condition category relative to general childhood population health, as well as the independent effects of methodological factors. Results. The literature searches resulted in 272 eligible studies. These yielded 3,414 utilities when all sub-groups were considered, covering all ICD-10 chapters relevant to childhood health, 19 valuation methods, 12 respondent types, 8 modes of administration, and data from 36 countries. A total of 1,191 utility values were obtained when only main study samples were considered, and these were catalogued by health condition or descriptor, and methodological characteristics. 1,073 mean utilities for main samples were used for fixed-effects meta-analysis by health condition and valuation method. Mixed-effects meta-regressions estimated that 53 of 76 ICD-10 delineated health conditions, valued using the HUI3, were associated with statistically significant utility decrements relative to general population health, whereas 38 of 57 valued using a visual analog scale (VAS) were associated with statistically significant VAS decrements. For both methods, parental proxy assessment was associated with overestimation of values, whereas adolescents reported lower values than children under 12 y. VAS responses were more heavily influenced by mode of administration than the HUI3. Conclusion. Utilities and their associated distributions, as well as the independent contributions of methodological factors, revealed by this systematic review and meta-analysis can inform future economic evaluations within the childhood context.},

MRD for the bcl-2/IgH translocation was determined on bone marrow cells in a centralized laboratory belonging to the Euro-MRD consortium, using qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). Of 234 enrolled patients, 227 (97\%) were screened at diagnosis. A molecular marker (MM) was found in 51\%. Patients with an MM were monitored at 8 subsequent times. Of the 675 expected follow-up samples, 83\% were analyzed. Conversion to PCR negativity predicted better progression-free survival (PFS) at all post-treatment times (eg, end of therapy: 3-year PFS, 72\% vs 39\%; P {$<$} .007). MRD was predictive in both maintenance (83\% vs 60\%; P {$<$} .007) and observation (71\% vs 50\%; P {$<$} .001) groups. PCR positivity at the end of induction was an independent adverse predictor (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% confidence interval, 1.36-7.07). MRD is a powerful independent outcome predictor in FL patients who receive rituximab-intensive programs, suggesting a need to investigate its value for decision-making.

The cure fraction is of interest to patients and a useful measure to monitor trends and differences in survival of curable disease. I will describe the strsmix and strsnmix commands, which fit the two main types of cure fraction model, namely, the mixture and nonmixture cure fraction models. These models allow incorporation of the expected background mortality rate and thus enable the modeling of relative survival when cure is a possibility.

The results were compared with a reference group of 1092 persons with no history of cancer (age range, 15\textendash 33 years, 55\% female). The impact of demographic and medical characteristics on psychosocial adjustment was studied. All participants completed a self\textendash report questionnaire. The results showed that, although many survivors are functioning well and leading normal lives, a subgroup of survivors were less likely to complete high-school, to attain an advanced graduate degree, to follow normal elementary or secondary school and had to be enrolled more often on learning disabled programs. The percentage of employed survivors was lower than the percentage of employed controls in the comparison group, but more survivors were student or homemaker. Survivors had lower rates of marriage and parenthood, and worried more about their fertility and the risk of their children having cancer. Survivors, especially males, lived more often with their parents. Cranial irradiation dose {$\leq$}25 Gy was an important independent prognostic factor of lower educational achievement. Survivors with a history of brain/CNS tumours had a higher risk of being single than survivors with a diagnosis of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These results indicate that important aspects of life are affected in a substantial number of persons who have been diagnosed with cancer during childhood or adolescence.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In health technology assessments (HTAs) of interventions that affect survival, it is essential to accurately estimate the survival benefit associated with the new treatment. Generally, trial data must be extrapolated, and many models are available for this purpose. The choice of extrapolation model is critical because different models can lead to very different cost-effectiveness results. A failure to systematically justify the chosen model creates the possibility of bias and inconsistency between HTAs. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the limitations and inconsistencies associated with the survival analysis component of HTAs and to propose a process guide that will help exclude these from future analyses. METHODS: We reviewed the survival analysis component of 45 HTAs undertaken for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the cancer disease area. We drew upon our findings to identify common limitations and to develop a process guide. RESULTS: The chosen survival models were not systematically justified in any of the HTAs reviewed. The range of models considered was usually insufficient, and the rationale for the chosen model was universally limited: In particular, the plausibility of the extrapolated portion of fitted survival curves was very rarely explicitly considered. Limitations. We do not seek to describe and review all methods available for performing survival analysis-several approaches exist that are not mentioned in this article. Instead we seek to analyze methods commonly used in HTAs and limitations associated with their application. CONCLUSIONS: Survival analysis has not been conducted systematically in HTAs. A systematic approach such as the one proposed here is required to reduce the possibility of bias in cost-effectiveness results and inconsistency between technology assessments.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the survival of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) recorded in the Belgian SCD Registry and to assess the impact of disease-modifying treatments (DMT). Method The Registry created in 2008 included patients of eight centers. All available data in 2008 were retrospectively encoded in the database. After 2008 and until 2012, all data were recorded prospectively for already registered patients as well as newly diagnosed subjects. Data were registered from neonatal screening or from diagnosis (first contact) until last follow-up or death. Data included diagnosis, demography, and outcome data. Results We collected data from 469 patients over a 5,110 patient years (PY) follow-up period. The global mortality rate was low (0.25/100 PY), although 13 patients died (2.8\%) and was similar between children, adolescents (10\textendash 18 years), and young adults (P = 0.76). Out of the cohort, 185 patients received hydroxyurea at last follow-up (median duration of treatment: 10.3 years), 90 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 24 were chronically transfused, and 170 had never had any DMT. Hydroxyurea showed significant benefit on patients outcome as reflected by a lower mortality rate compared to transplanted individuals or people without DMT (0.14, 0.36, and 0.38 per 100 PY, respectively) and by higher Kaplan\textendash Meier estimates of 15 year survival (99.4\%) compared to HSCT (93.8\%; P = 0.01) or no DMT groups (95.4\%; P = 0.04). Conclusion SCD mortality in Belgium is low with no increase observed in young adults. Patients treated with hydroxyurea demonstrate a significant benefit in survival when compared to those without DMT or transplanted.

  abstract = {Objectives To estimate the daily cost of intensive care unit (ICU) stays via micro-costing. Methods A multicentre, prospective, observational, cost analysis study was carried out among 21 out of 23 French ICUs randomly selected from French National Hospitals. Each ICU randomly enrolled 5 admitted adult patients with a simplified acute physiology II score {$\geq$} 15 and with at least one major intensive care medical procedure. All health-care human resources used by each patient over a 24-hour period were recorded, as well as all medications, laboratory analyses, investigations, tests, consumables and administrative expenses. All resource costs were estimated from the hospital's perspective (reference year 2009) based on unitary cost data. Results One hundred and four patients were included (mean age: 62.3{$\pm$}14.9 years, mean SAPS II: 51.5{$\pm$}16.1, mean SOFA on the study day: 6.9{$\pm$}4.3). Over 24hours, 29 to 186 interventions per patient were performed by different caregivers, leading to a mean total time spent for patient care of 13:32{$\pm$}05:00h. The total daily cost per patient was \texteuro 1425{$\pm\euro$}520 (95\% CI=\texteuro 1323 to \texteuro 1526). ICU human resources represented 43\% of total daily cost. Patient-dependent expenses (\texteuro 842{$\pm\euro$}521) represented 59\% of the total daily cost. The total daily cost was correlated with the daily SOFA score (r=0.271, P=0.006) and the bedside-time given by caregivers (r=0.716, P{$<$}0.0001). Conclusion The average cost of one day of ICU care in French National Hospitals is strongly correlated with the duration of bedside-care carried out by human resources.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically respond well to first-line immunochemotherapy. At relapse, single-agent rituximab is commonly administered. Data suggest the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide could increase the activity of rituximab. METHODS A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab was conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients received lenalidomide or placebo for 12 cycles plus rituximab once per week for 4 weeks in cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2 through 5. The primary end point was progression-free survival per independent radiology review. RESULTS A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide plus rituximab (n = 178) or placebo plus rituximab (n = 180). Infections (63\% v 49\%), neutropenia (58\% v 23\%), and cutaneous reactions (32\% v 12\%) were more common with lenalidomide plus rituximab. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (50\% v 13\%) and leukopenia (7\% v 2\%) were higher with lenalidomide plus rituximab; no other grade 3 or 4 adverse event differed by 5\% or more between groups. Progression-free survival was significantly improved for lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab, with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P {$<$} .001) and median duration of 39.4 months (95\% CI, 22.9 months to not reached) versus 14.1 months (95\% CI, 11.4 to 16.7 months), respectively. CONCLUSION Lenalidomide improved efficacy of rituximab in patients with recurrent indolent lymphoma, with an acceptable safety profile.},

  abstract = {Objective Well-established cancer registries that routinely link to death registrations can estimate prevalence directly by counting patients alive at a particular point in time (observed prevalence). Such direct methods can only provide prevalence for the years over which the registry has been operational. Time-defined estimates, including 5- and 10-year prevalence, may however underestimate the total cancer burden, and compared with other cancers, there is a lack of accurate information on the total prevalence of hematological malignancy subtypes. Accordingly, we aimed to estimate prevalence (observed and total prevalence) of hematological malignancies and precursor conditions by clinically meaningful subtypes using data from the UK's specialist population-based register, the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (www.hmrn.org). Methods Observed and total prevalences were estimated from 15,810 new diagnoses of hematological malignancies from 2004 to 2011 and followed up to the 31 August 2011 (index data). Observed prevalence was calculated by the counting method, and a method based on modelling incidence and survival was used to estimate total prevalence. Estimates were made according to current disease classification for the HMRN region and for the UK. Results The overall observed and total prevalence rates were 281.9 and 548.8 per 100,000, respectively; the total number of observed and total prevalent cases in the UK was estimated as 165,841 and 327,818 cases, as expected variation existed by disease subtype reflecting the heterogeneity in underlying disease incidence, survival and age distribution of hematological cancers. Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of estimating `total' prevalence rather than `observed' prevalence by current disease classification (ICD-O-3), particularly for subtypes that have a more indolent nature and for those that are curable. Importantly, these analyses demonstrate that relying on observed prevalence alone would result in a significant underestimation of the relative burden of some subtypes. While many of these cases may be considered cured and no longer being actively treated, people in this survivorship phase may have long-term medical needs and accordingly, it is important to provide accurate counts to allow for healthcare planning.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma worldwide, representing approximately 30\textendash 40\% of all cases in different geographic regions. Patients most often present with a rapidly growing tumour mass in single or multiple, nodal or extranodal sites. The most common type of DLBCL, designated as not otherwise specified, represents 80\textendash 85\% of all cases and is the focus of this review. There are also rare types of lymphoma composed of large B-cells, in aggregate about 15\textendash 20\% of all neoplasms that are sufficiently distinctive to recognise separately. DLBCL not otherwise specified (referred to henceforth as DLBCL) is a heterogeneous entity in terms of clinical presentation, genetic findings, response to therapy, and prognosis. A major advance was the application of gene expression profiling (GEP) to the study of DLBCL which further clarified this heterogeneity and provided a rationale for subdividing cases into groups. The most popular system divides cases of DLBCL according to cell-of-origin into germinal centre B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC) subtypes, with about 10\textendash 15\% of cases being unclassifiable. Patients with the GCB subtype usually have better prognosis than patients with the ABC subtype. Although cell-of-origin is useful for predicting outcome, the GCB and ABC subtypes remain heterogeneous, with better and worse prognostic subsets within each group. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of DLBCL has facilitated global identification of numerous and diverse genetic abnormalities in these neoplasms and has shown that GCB and ABC tumours have different mutation profiles. Although the therapy of patients with DLBCL is an active area of research, the current 5-year overall survival rate is 60\textendash 70\% using standard-of-care frontline therapy. A precision medicine approach for the design of new therapies based on molecular findings in DLBCL is likely the best path forward. As pathologists, our role has expanded beyond diagnosis. We must perform a complete work-up of DLBCL cases. In addition to our traditional role in establishing the diagnosis, we need to analyse markers that provide information regarding prognosis and potential therapeutic targets. We also must ensure that adequate tissue is triaged for molecular studies which are essential for designing therapy regimens, particularly in the setting of disease relapse.},

  abstract = {Purpose The anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel was recently approved to treat relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With a one-time infusion cost of \$475,000, tisagenlecleucel is currently the most expensive oncologic therapy. We aimed to determine whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective compared with currently available treatments. Methods Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% discount rate). Results With an assumption of a 40\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost \$61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive (\$151,000/QALY gained). At a 0\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisa-genlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost \$184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to \$200,000 or \$350,000 would allow it to meet a \$100,000/QALY or \$150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. Conclusion The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds. Price reductions would favorably influence cost effectiveness even if long-term clinical outcomes are modest.},

  abstract = {Objective: Studies have shown that a proportion of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with standard chemotherapy will have long-term life expectancy comparable to those in the age-adjusted general population. This systematic literature review summarizes current literature regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of long-term ( 2 years) survivors of aggressive NHL. Methods: Electronic databases (without restriction on years) and abstracts from four major oncology and HRQoL conferences from 2014 to 2017 were searched. Studies were included if HRQoL or health utility was assessed at least 2 years after NHL diagnosis. Studies focusing on central nervous system lymphoma, or indolent NHL, were excluded. Results were categorized relative to baseline (improvement, deterioration or no change) and compared to the general population (better, comparable or worse). Results: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve studies included  1 HRQoL instrument, and two measured health utilities using EQ-5D. Half of the studies showed improvement (5/10) and half no change (5/10) in overall HRQoL. Compared to the general population, overall HRQoL was more comparable when assessed at  3 years from baseline (3/3 better or comparable) versus assessment at {$<$}3 years (2/3 better or comparable). Six studies reported on the physical HRQoL domain with improvement in 4/6 studies and no change in 2/6 studies. Conclusions: HRQoL of NHL survivors may improve from baseline and becomes more comparable to general population HRQoL with longer survival. Overall HRQoL improvement is driven mostly by improvements in the physical domain.},

  abstract = {PURPOSETwo anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel; each costs \$373,000. We evaluated their cost effectiveness.METHODSWe used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.RESULTSIn an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40\% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at \$129,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$90,000 to \$219,000). At a 30\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive (\$159,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35\% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at \$168,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$414,000/QALY). At a 25\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive (\$223,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$123,000 to \$1,170,000/QALY]). Administering CAR-T to all indicated patients would increase US health care costs by approximately \$10 billion over 5 years. Price reductions to \$250,000 and \$200,000, respectively, or payment only for initial complete response (at current prices) would allow axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel to cost less than \$150,000/QALY, even at 25\% PFS.CONCLUSIONAt 2018 prices, it is possible that both CAR-T therapies meet a less than \$150,000/QALY threshold. This depends on long-term outcomes compared with chemoimmunotherapy and stem-cell transplantation, which are uncertain. Widespread adoption would substantially increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma health care costs. Price reductions or payment for initial response would improve cost effectiveness, even with modest long-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {8049  Background: The National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) collects data on disease presentation, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes for 2736 patients with with follicular lymphoma diagnosed 2004-2007 in the USA. Patterns of initial management (Rx1) in this cohort were reported previously (Friedberg, JCO 2009). The current report describes patterns of second-line therapy (Rx2). Methods: Data from pts enrolled in NLCS with a diagnosis of FL and active Rx1 were analyzed to establish patterns of Rx2. Therapy after initial period of observation is considered Rx1 for this analysis. Results: Of 2736 pts enrolled, 1841 remain in active follow-up after median 4.9 years and 991 had received Rx2 with median TTRx2 from Rx1 of 11.1 mos. 325 began Rx2 within six months of beginning Rx1, and 521 within a year. Thus far, 252 pts have begun Rx2 {$>$} 2 yrs following Rx1. 89\% of Rx2 were for progressive disease, 10\% toxicity, and 1\% both. Seventy-one (7.3\%) of the 991 received XRT monotherapy, 62 (6.3\%) received therapy as part of a clinical trial and the rest received systemic therapy \textendash{} most frequently rituximab plus chemotherapy (36.1\%, median TTRx2 9.1mos) and rituximab monotherapy (32.4\%, median TTRx2 14.1mos). 82 pts received chemotherapy alone, 33 received radioimmunotherapy, and 15 underwent BMT as part of Rx2. Among 461 pts receiving non-investigational chemotherapy, 154 received an anthracycline (median TTRx2 6.4 mos), 270 did not (median TTRx2 9.5mos) and 37 had incomplete data. After Rx2, 61\% of pts remained anthracycline naive. Of pts who received investigational therapy as Rx2, 25.8\% had received investigational therapy as Rx1, compared to 6.2\% for the remaining Rx2 groups. Conclusions: Among the first half of NLCS pts who have received Rx2, a few notable patterns emerge: R-monotherapy is utilized more frequently as Rx2 than as Rx1; rituximab is again utilized frequently as part of Rx2, even when TTRX2 is short, presumably representing rituximab resistance by common definitions; and most pts remain anthracycline na\"ive. These data give some clarity to the characteristics of pts available for clinical research in the relapsed/refractory setting of FL, although patterns may change as pts who have longer interval to Rx2 are included over time.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal studies are often applied in biomedical research and clinical trials to evaluate the treatment effect. The association pattern within the subject must be considered in both sample size calculation and the analysis. One of the most important approaches to analyze such a study is the generalized estimating equation (GEE) proposed by Liang and Zeger, in which ``working correlation structure'' is introduced and the association pattern within the subject depends on a vector of association parameters denoted by {$\rho$}. The explicit sample size formulas for two-group comparison in linear and logistic regression models are obtained based on the GEE method by Liu and Liang. For cluster randomized trials (CRTs), researchers proposed the optimal sample sizes at both the cluster and individual level as a function of sampling costs and the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). In these approaches, the optimal sample sizes depend strongly on the ICC. However, the ICC is usually unknown for cluster randomized and multicenter trials. To overcome this shortcoming, Van Breukelen et al consider a range of possible ICC values identified from literature reviews and present Maximin designs (MMDs) based on relative efficiency (RE) and efficiency under budget and cost constraints. In this paper, the optimal sample size and number of repeated measurements using GEE models with an exchangeable working correlation matrix is proposed under the considerations of fixed budget, where ``optimal'' refers to maximum power for a given sampling budget. The equations of sample size and number of repeated measurements for a known parameter value {$\rho$} are derived and a straightforward algorithm for unknown {$\rho$} is developed. Applications in practice are discussed. We also discuss the existence of the optimal design when an AR(1) working correlation matrix is assumed. Our proposed method can be extended under the scenarios when the true and working correlation matrix are different.},

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were based on a matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (MAIC) that accounted for differences in trial population baseline characteristics. Mixture-cure models (MCMs) were used to account for long-term survivors. Costs included drug acquisition and administration for the CAR T-cell therapies and conditioning chemotherapy, apheresis, CAR T-specific monitoring, transplant, hospitalization, adverse events, routine care, and terminal care. Health state utilities were derived from trial and published data. Sensitivity analyses included probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and an analysis of extremes that assessed the results across a vast array of combinations of parametric OS and PFS curves across the 2 therapies.Results Compared to tisa-cel, axi-cel resulted in 2.31 QALYs gained and a cost reduction of \$1,407 in the base case. In the PSA, the cost per QALY gained was {$\leq\$$}31,500 in 95\% of the 1,000 simulations. In the analysis of extremes, the cost per QALY gained was {$\leq\$$}7,500 in 99\% of the 1,296 combinations of MCMs and {$\leq\$$}40,000 in 95\% of the 1,296 combinations of standard models.Limitations In absence of head-to-head comparative data, we relied on a MAIC, which cannot account for all possible confounders. Moreover, some outcomes (i.e., transplantations, hospitalizations, AEs) were not adjusted in the MAIC.Conclusions In this simulation, axi-cel was a superior treatment option as it is predicted to achieve better outcomes at lower or minimal incremental costs versus tisa-cel.},

Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by polymerase chain reaction-based methods is routinely employed in the management of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Current knowledge indicates that it is also a useful prognostic tool in several mature lymphoproliferative disorders and particularly in follicular lymphoma (FL). Based on this evidence clinical trials employing MRD-based risk stratification are currently ongoing in FL. In this review the `state of the art' of MRD evaluation in FL is discussed. A short description of technical issues and recent methodological advances is provided. Then, the bulk of the review focuses on critical take-home messages for clinicians working in the field. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of MRD detection and more generally outcome prediction in FL.},

The ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase protein cereblon (CRBN) has been identified as the primary teratogenic target of thalidomide. Our studies demonstrate that thalidomide, lenalidomide and another immunomodulatory drug, pomalidomide, bound endogenous CRBN and recombinant CRBN-DNA damage binding protein-1 (DDB1) complexes. CRBN mediated antiproliferative activities of lenalidomide and pomalidomide in myeloma cells, as well as lenalidomide- and pomalidomide-induced cytokine production in T cells. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide inhibited autoubiquitination of CRBN in HEK293T cells expressing thalidomide-binding competent wild-type CRBN, but not thalidomide-binding defective CRBN(YW/AA). Overexpression of CRBN wild-type protein, but not CRBN(YW/AA) mutant protein, in KMS12 myeloma cells, amplified pomalidomide-mediated reductions in c-myc and IRF4 expression and increases in p21(WAF-1) expression. Long-term selection for lenalidomide resistance in H929 myeloma cell lines was accompanied by a reduction in CRBN, while in DF15R myeloma cells resistant to both pomalidomide and lenalidomide, CRBN protein was undetectable. Our biophysical, biochemical and gene silencing studies show that CRBN is a proximate, therapeutically important molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide.},

  abstract = {Background Blood disorders comprise a wide range of diseases including anaemia, malignant blood disorders, and haemorrhagic disorders. Although they are a common cause of disease, no systematic cost-of-illness studies have been done to assess the economic effect of non-malignant blood disorders in Europe. We aimed to assess the economic burden of non-malignant blood disorders across the 28 countries of the European Union (EU), Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. Methods Non-malignant blood disorder-related costs (WHO International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD] D50\textendash 89) were estimated for 28 EU countries, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland for 2012. Country-specific costs were estimated with aggregate data on morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use obtained from international and national sources. Health-care costs were estimated from expenditure on primary care, outpatient care, emergency care, hospital inpatient care, and drugs. Costs of informal care and productivity losses due to morbidity and early death were also included. To these costs we added those due to malignant blood disorders (ICD-10 C81\textendash 96 and D47) as estimated in a Burns and colleagues' companion Article to obtain the total costs of blood disorders. Findings Non-malignant disorders of the blood cost the 31 European countries \texteuro 11 billion in 2012. Health-care costs accounted for \texteuro 8 billion (75\% of total costs), productivity losses for \texteuro 2 billion (19\%), and informal care for less than \texteuro 1 billion (6\%). Averaged across the European population studied, non-malignant disorders of the blood represented an annual health-care cost of \texteuro 159 per ten citizens. Combining malignant and non-malignant blood disorders, the total cost of blood disorders was \texteuro 23 billion in 2012. Interpretation Our study highlights the economic burden that non-malignant blood disorders place on European health-care systems and societies. Our study also shows that blood disorder costs were evenly distributed between malignant and non-malignant blood disorders. Our results should be of use to decision makers and research-funding authorities charged with allocating health-care resources and research funds. Funding European Hematology Association.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ongoing monitoring of late mortality among survivors of a childhood or adolescent cancer is essential to appropriately evaluate risk in more recent cohorts and with longer follow-up. We examined overall and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort of 2,354 individuals diagnosed with a cancer or tumor prior to 20 years of age between 1970 and 1995 in British Columbia (BC), Canada who survived at least 5 years. PROCEDURE: Late deaths in a survivor cohort ascertained from the BC Cancer Registry were identified using death registrations. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risk of death, and cumulative risk of death were determined. Demographic, temporal, and disease-related factors in risk of late mortality were also assessed. RESULTS: After 24,491 person-years of follow-up, there were 181 deaths, 139 of which were cancer related. Excess risk of late mortality among survivors was 7 deaths per 1,000 person-years at risk (AER = 6.6). Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was ninefold higher relative to the underlying BC population (SMR = 9.1, 95\% CI, 7.8-10.5), and was greatest for those with a recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis, and for those diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and nervous system tumors. Absolute excess risk of late death was significantly higher for males and for those diagnosed prior to 1980, but did not vary according to age at diagnosis. Relative mortality was significantly increased due to cancer-related causes of death (SMR = 81.7, 95\% CI, 68.6-95.8), as well as circulatory (SMR = 9.7, 95\% CI, 4.2-19.1) and respiratory (SMR = 16.8, 95\% CI, 4.6-43.0) diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort with long follow-up, there continues to be excess late mortality among childhood and adolescent cancer survivors due to both cancer and non-cancer causes, even among more recently diagnosed survivors.},

Exploiting rich data from archives and 44 semi-structured interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018, we employ Multiple Streams Analysis to construct a complex and dynamic picture of how the idea of QALYs emerged and was adopted within UK health policy. Through its historical and political approach, the paper illuminates the relative roles in the policy-making process of experts (especially economists) and politicians as `entrepreneurs' in the development of new ideas; how these were influenced by negotiation within established and emerging institutional structures; and the role of serendipity and crisis.},

Despite the refinement of chemoimmunotherapy, a substantial number of patients experience chemorefractory disease.

Based on the promising results obtained from pivotal trials, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Nonetheless, there remain several controversial issues and problems awaiting solutions, including optimal management of toxicities, overcoming relapsed/refractory disease after CAR T-cell therapy, and improving CAR-T manufacturing platform. Definite unmet medical needs among patients with chemorefractory B-cell NHL still exist. CAR T-cell therapy might be a game changer that can defeat chemorefractory B-cell NHL, and further clinical development is warranted.

  abstract = {Biological products for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis usually are cost effective for healthcare systems in Europe, but they are huge financial burden due to the high number of patients and the significant budget impact. The expected saving from introduction on the market of biosimilars are significant and are linked to better access and affordability. The aim of this study was to conduct comparative price analysis of biological products for rheumatoid arthritis therapy among seventeen EU countries. The point of view is that of the Bulgarian pricing and reimbursement system and the chosen countries are those from external reference basket for prices comparison at manufacturing level. All authorized biological products by EMA with therapeutic indication rheumatoid arthritis were selected. The access for treatment is evaluated as the availability of the product on the market and the prices level. We assessed the availability of all trade names in the price lists of the observed countries. The prices data was obtained from the official web pages of the responsible institutions up to date December 2017. The results show that four out of all six INNs have authorized biosimilars in EMA. Despite its earlier authorization biosimilar adalimumab is not present in any of the price lists of countries. From all eighteen countries only in Lithuania and Estonia there were no published prices of any of the selected medicinal products. Countries with higher number of biosimilar prices are Spain and France. Differences in manufacturers' prices of reference biological products in selected countries in comparison with the lowest manufacturer price are higher with 22 to 69\% while the retail prices between 62 and 95\%. Differences are mostly notable for rituximab, and less notable for tocilizumab. Manufacturers' and retail prices of biosimilar products were established only for three INNs (etanercept, rituximab, and infliximab). Manufacturers' prices differ between 26 and 75\%, while retail prices differ between 40 and 92\% for biosimilars. Comparison of the differences between manufacturer prices of reference biological product and biosimilars shows 36\% difference for etanercept, 39\% for rituximab, and 31\% for infliximab, while at retail level the differences are 11, 86, and 143\%, respectively. The limitation of the study is that the prices are the official ones without discounts due to confidentiality and the real prices may be lower. The second limitation is that the methodology for pricing differs in the countries and this could also influence the prices on both levels (manufacturer and retail). Introduction of biosimilars on the national markets led to significant decrease in reimbursed prices paid by public funds and thus might benefit the patients' access to biological therapy. The decrease of prices after biosimilars entrance on the market is not as notable as for commodity generics.},

Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, is active in follicu-lar lymphoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Previously untreated patients with stages III to IV follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either 8 cycles of CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP; n 162) or CVP (n 159). Overall and complete response rates were 81\% and 41\% in the R-CVP arm versus 57\% and 10\% in the CVP arm, respectively (P {$<$} .0001). At a median follow up of 30 months, patients treated with R-CVP had a very significantly prolonged time to progression (median 32 months versus 15 months for CVP; P {$<$} .0001). Median time to treatment failure was 27 months in patients receiving R-CVP and 7 months in the CVP arm (P {$<$} .0001). Rituximab did not add significantly to the toxicity of CVP. The addition of rituximab to the CVP regimen significantly improves the clinical outcome in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, without increased toxicity.

Since the field lacks formal precedents establishing a comparative basis for assessing the efficacy and safety of new investigational agents, the design of trials to demonstrate overall clinical benefit with statistical certainty remains extremely difficult both for academic and industry sponsors. As a step toward addressing this problem, a panel of experts met on two occasions to reach consensus on recommendations for terminology defining a clinically meaningful primary endpoint in studies assessing treatment for acute GVHD. The panel recommended terminology for ``very good partial response'' that includes both diagnostic and functional criteria. Assessment of response at day 28 after starting treatment is appropriate for the primary end point, but later time points can be considered. Since treatment agents can be designed for use on a single occasion, on repeated occasions as needed, or continuously, durability of response should not be required as a component in the primary end point of the initial trials, although follow-up trials may be needed in order to define the optimal conditions of use and the associated risks and benefits, and sustained response may be essential for optimal clinical benefit.},

Despite many studies, practices vary considerably with respect to the selection of agents for treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant or refractory GVHD. Investigators and clinicians have recognized the lack of progress and lamented the absence of an accepted standard of care for secondary treatment of aGVHD. The American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation has developed recommendations for treatment of aGVHD to be considered by care providers, based on a comprehensive and critical review of published reports. Because the literature provides little basis for a definitive guideline, this review also provides a framework for the interpretation of previous results and the design of future studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation can cure hematologic malignancies and other diseases, but this treatment can also cause late complications. Previous studies have evaluated the cumulative effects of late complications on survival, but longer-term effects on life expectancy after hematopoietic cell transplantation have not been assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used standard methods to evaluate mortality, projected life expectancy, and causes of death in a cohort of 2,574 patients who survived without recurrence of the original disease for at least 5 years after allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation from 1970 through 2002. Sex- and age-specific comparisons were made with US population data. RESULTS: Estimated survival of the cohort at 20 years after transplantation was 80.4\% (95\% CI, 78.1\% to 82.6\%). During 22,923 person-years of follow-up, 357 deaths occurred. Mortality rates remained four- to nine-fold higher than the expected population rate for at least 30 years after transplantation, yielding an estimated 30\% lower life expectancy compared with that in the general population, regardless of current age. In rank order, the leading causes of excess deaths were second malignancies and recurrent disease, followed by infections, chronic graft-versus-host disease, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: Patients who have survived for at least 5 years after hematopoietic cell transplantation without recurrence of the original disease have a high probability of surviving for an additional 15 years, but life expectancy is not fully restored. Further effort is needed to reduce the burden of disease and treatment-related complications in this population.},

Similarly to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England, the National Authority for Health (HAS), which is responsible for economic evaluation of new health technologies in France, has published recommendations on the methods of economic evaluation. Since economic assessment represents a major element of HTA in England, exploring the differences between these methodological guidelines might help to comprehend both the shape and the role economic assessment is intended to have in the French health care system.MethodsMethodological guidelines for economic evaluation in France and England have been compared topic-by-topic in order to bring out key differences in the recommended methods for economic evaluation.ResultsThe analysis of both guidelines has revealed multiple similarities between France and England, although a number of differences were also noted regarding the elected methodology of analysis, the comparison of studies' outcomes with cost-effectiveness thresholds, the study population to consider, the quality of life valuation methods, the perspective on costs, the types of resources considered and their valuation, the discount rates to apply in order to reflect the present value of interventions, etc. To account for these differences, modifications will be required in order to adapt economic models from one country to the other.ConclusionsChanges in HTA assessment methods occur in response to different challenges determined by the different philosophical and cultural considerations surrounding health and welfare as well as the political considerations regarding the role of public policies and the importance of their evaluation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is difficult to treat despite the availability of aggressive therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor\textendash modified T cells targeting CD19 may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies and induce remission in patients with refractory disease. METHODS We infused autologous T cells transduced with a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CTL019) lentiviral vector in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL at doses of 0.76\texttimes 106 to 20.6\texttimes 106 CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. Patients were monitored for a response, toxic effects, and the expansion and persistence of circulating CTL019 T cells. RESULTS A total of 30 children and adults received CTL019. Complete remission was achieved in 27 patients (90\%), including 2 patients with blinatumomab-refractory disease and 15 who had undergone stem-cell transplantation. CTL019 cells proliferated in vivo and were detectable in the blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients who had a response. Sustained remission was achieved with a 6-month event-free survival rate of 67\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 51 to 88) and an overall survival rate of 78\% (95\% CI, 65 to 95). At 6 months, the probability that a patient would have persistence of CTL019 was 68\% (95\% CI, 50 to 92) and the probability that a patient would have relapse-free B-cell aplasia was 73\% (95\% CI, 57 to 94). All the patients had the cytokine-release syndrome. Severe cytokine-release syndrome, which developed in 27\% of the patients, was associated with a higher disease burden before infusion and was effectively treated with the anti\textendash interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab.

  abstract = {3011Background: Targeted immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can produce potent anti-tumor responses. We previously reported complete remissions (CR) and prolonged persistence in children and adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with CD19-specific CART cells (CTL019). We now report on outcomes and longer follow-up of 59 children with r/r ALL. Methods: T cells collected from the patient were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a CAR composed of anti-CD19 scFv, CD3z, and 4-1BB domains, activated/expanded ex vivo with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, and then infused at a dose of 107 to 108cells/kg with a transduction efficiency of 2.3-45\%. 54/59 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy the week prior to cell infusion. Results: Of 59 patients aged 20mo-24y with CD19+ ALL, 44 had detectable disease prior to CTL019 cell infusion, while 15 were MRD-. 39 were treated for relapse after prior stem cell transplant (SCT). 15 patients had CNS disease within a year of infusion. At assessment 1 month after infusion, 55/59 (93\%) were in CR. MRD {$<$} 0.01\% by flow cytometry was achieved in 52 patients. CTL019 cells were detected in the CSF and no CNS relapses have been seen. With median follow-up 12 mo (1-43 mo), 34 patients had ongoing CR, with only 6 receiving subsequent therapy (5 SCT, 1 donor lymphocyte infusion), RFS was 76\% (95\% CI, 65-89\%) at 6 mo and 55\% at 12 mo (95\% CI, 42-73\%), and OS was 79\% (95\% CI, 69-91\%) at 12 mo. 20 patients subsequently relapsed, 13 with CD19- disease. CTL019 persistence was accompanied by B cell aplasia, which continued up to last assessment (1-39 mo) in 24/34 patients with ongoing CR. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was seen in 88\% of patients. Severe CRS requiring hemodynamic or respiratory support occurred in 27\%, was associated with high disease burden, and was reversed with the anti-IL6R agent tocilizumab. We could predict development of severe CRS through regression modeling using IFN{$\gamma$}, sgp130, and sIL1RA measured in the first 72h (sens 86\%, spec 89\%, AUC 0.93). Conclusions: Single-agent CTL019 immunotherapy can induce durable responses with control of CNS disease in patients with r/r ALL. Clinical trial information: NCT01626495.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In a single-center phase 1\textendash 2a study, the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel produced high rates of complete remission and was associated with serious but mainly reversible toxic effects in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months. RESULTS For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81\%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90\% (95\% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50\% (95\% CI, 35 to 64) and 76\% (95\% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73\% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77\% of patients, 48\% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40\% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.

  abstract = {Recent advances in follicular lymphoma (FL) have resulted in prolongation of overall survival (OS). Here we assessed if early events as defined by event-free survival (EFS) at 12 and 24 months from diagnosis (EFS12/EFS24) can inform subsequent OS in FL. 920 newly diagnosed grade 1-3A FL patients enrolled on the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) from 2002-2012 were initially evaluated. EFS was defined as time from diagnosis to progression, relapse, re-treatment, or death due to any cause. OS was compared to age-and-sex-matched survival in the general US population using standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). We used a cohort of 412 FL patients from two Lyon, France hospital registries for independent replication. Patients who failed to achieve EFS12 had poor subsequent OS (MER SMR = 3.72, 95\%CI: 2.78-4.88; Lyon SMR = 8.74, 95\%CI: 5.41-13.36). Conversely, patients achieving EFS12 had no added mortality beyond the background population (MER SMR = 0.73, 95\%CI: 0.56-0.94, Lyon SMR = 1.02, 95\%CI: 0.58-1.65). Patients with early events after immunochemotherapy had especially poor outcomes (EFS12 failure: MER SMR = 17.63, 95\%CI:11.97-25.02, Lyon SMR = 19.10, 95\%CI:9.86-33.36; EFS24 failure: MER SMR = 13.02, 95\%CI:9.31-17.74, Lyon SMR = 7.22, 95\%CI:4.13-11.74). In a combined dataset of all patients from both cohorts, baseline FLIPI was no longer informative in EFS12 achievers. Reassessment of patient status at 12 months from diagnosis in follicular lymphoma patients, or at 24 months in patients treated with immunochemotherapy, is a strong predictor of subsequent overall survival in FL. Early event status provides a simple, clinically relevant endpoint for studies assessing outcome in FL. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1096-1101, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Objective There is growing recognition that a comprehensive economic assessment of a new health-care intervention at the time of launch requires both a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and a budget impact analysis (BIA). National regulatory agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in England and Wales and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia, as well as managed care organizations in the United States, now require that companies submit estimates of both the cost-effectiveness and the likely impact of the new health-care interventions on national, regional, or local health plan budgets. Although standard methods for performing and presenting the results of CEAs are well accepted, the same progress has not been made for BIAs. The objective of this report is to present guidance on methodologies for those undertaking such analyses or for those reviewing the results of such analyses. Methods The Task Force was appointed with the advice and consent of the Board of Directors of ISPOR. Members were experienced developers or users of budget impact models, worked in academia, industry, and as advisors to governments, and came from several countries in North America, Oceana, Asia, and Europe. The Task Force met to develop core assumptions and an outline before preparing a draft report. They solicited comments on the outline and two drafts from a core group of external reviewers and more broadly from the membership of ISPOR at two ISPOR meetings and via the ISPOR web site. Results The Task Force recommends that the budget impact of a new health technology should consider the perspective of the specific health-care decision-maker. As such, the BIA should be performed using data that reflect, for a specific health condition, the size and characteristics of the population, the current and new treatment mix, the efficacy and safety of the new and current treatments, and the resourceuse and costs for the treatments and symptoms as would apply to the population of interest. The Task Force recommends that budget impact analyses be generated as a series of scenario analyses in the same manner that sensitivity analyses would be provided for CEAs. In particular, the input values for the calculation and the specific cost outcomes presented (a scenario) should be specific to a particular decision-maker's population and information needs. Sensitivity analysis should also be in the form of alternative scenarios chosen from the perspective of the decision-maker. The primary data sources for estimating the budget impact should be published clinical trial estimates and comparator studies for efficacy and safety of current and new technologies as well as, where possible, the decision-maker's own population for the other parameter estimates. Suggested default data sources also are recommended. These include the use of published data, well-recognized local or national statistical information and in special circumstances, expert opinion. Finally, the Task Force recommends that the analyst use the simplest design that will generate credible and transparent estimates. If a health condition model is needed for the BIA, it should reflect health outcomes and their related costs in the total affected population for each year after the new intervention is introduced into clinical practice. The model should be consistent with that used for the CEA with regard to clinical and economic assumptions. Conclusion The BIA is important, along with the CEA, as part of a comprehensive economic evaluation of a new health technology. We propose a framework for creating budget impact models, guidance about the acquisition and use of data to make budget projections and a common reporting format that will promote standardization and transparency. Adherence to these proposed good research practice principles would not necessarily supersede jurisdiction-specific budget impact guidelines, but may support and enhance localrecommendations or serve as a starting point for payers wishing to promulgate methodology guidelines.},

We assessed 750 cancer patients at the beginning (t0) and end (t1) of, and 12 months after (t2) inpatient cancer rehabilitation. At t0, 22\% had a desire to retire early. These patients reported significantly longer sick leave periods, less favourable workplace environments, lower work ability, higher psychological distress and lower quality of life than other patients. At t2, 12.5\% of patients received temporary or permanent early retirement pensions. Of all patients with a desire for early retirement at t0, 43\% had returned to work at t2. This subgroup had a significantly lower physical quality of life than other patients returning to work. The most influential predictors of early retirement were being on sick leave (OR = 6.50, 95\% CI = 1.97\textendash 21.47) and a desire for early retirement (OR = 5.61, 95\% CI = 2.73\textendash 11.52). Inverse predictors of early retirement were cancer remission (OR = 0.23, 95\% CI = 0.10\textendash 0.53), perceived productivity (OR = 0.38, 95\% CI = 0.18\textendash 0.83), work satisfaction (OR = 0.36, 95\% CI = 0.17\textendash 0.77) and mental quality of life (OR = 0.94, 95\% CI = 0.91\textendash 0.98).

  abstract = {In this book we describe how to elicit and analyze expert judgment. This book's definition of expert judgment includes both the experts' answers to technical questions and their mental processes in reaching an answer. Expert judgment refers specifically to data obtained in a deliberate, structured manner that makes use of the research on human cognition and communication. The book was written at the request of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the time, the Risk Analysis Division of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began to break new ground in gathering and using expert judgment in large probabilistic risk assessments. The book's content has been generalized to meet their needs and those of others using expert judgments. Our aim in this book is to provide a guide on expert judgment for lay persons. These lay persons may be from the physical and engineering sciences, mathematics and statistics, business, or the military. Alternatively, they may work in a field that has traditionally relied on expert judgment, such as risk analysis, reliability analysis, decision analysis, operations research, or knowledge acquisition (a branch of artificial intelligence). To illustrate, people working in the sciences and the military have often told us of their desire to obtain a detailed information source on how to gather and analyze expert judgment. Earlier, no source existed that could provide the guidance they (as lay persons) needed to design and conduct their own elicitations or analyses. The lack of usable literature on how to elicit information from experts stems from three reasons. First, the manner in which these techniques are learned does not lend itself to publication. Interviewing techniques in anthropology, psychology, and sociology are usually taught in laboratory situations. Students in these fields rarely attempt elicitation on their own; most learn the techniques by observing one of their professors. Thus, even within these specialized fields, few sources on elicitation can be found. Second, the sources that do exist have been specialized for a particular discipline or situation. As a result, attempting to generalize such sources can prove to be a most difficult task. Third, it is difficult to communicate elicitation techniques because the written medium is not well suited to conveying levels of information that are communicated through nonverbal means. Also, because most of the mechanics of elicitation have become automatic in the experienced practitioner, such mechanics become relatively inaccessible for retrieval.},

  abstract = {Background The standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who are not candidates for high-dose therapy is melphalan and prednisone. This phase 3 study compared the use of melphalan and prednisone with or without bortezomib in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma who were ineligible for high-dose therapy. Methods We randomly assigned 682 patients to receive nine 6-week cycles of melphalan (at a dose of 9 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and prednisone (at a dose of 60 mg per square meter) on days 1 to 4, either alone or with bortezomib (at a dose of 1.3 mg per square meter) on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 during cycles 1 to 4 and on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 during cycles 5 to 9. The primary end point was the time to disease progression. Results The time to progression among patients receiving bortezomib plus melphalan\textendash prednisone (bortezomib group) was 24.0 months, as compared with 16.6 months among those receiving melphalan\textendash prednisone alone (control group) (hazard ratio for the bortezomib group, 0.48; P{$<$}0.001). The proportions of patients with a partial response or better were 71\% in the bortezomib group and 35\% in the control group; complete-response rates were 30\% and 4\%, respectively (P{$<$}0.001). The median duration of the response was 19.9 months in the bortezomib group and 13.1 months in the control group. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.61 for the bortezomib group (P\,=\,0.008). Adverse events were consistent with established profiles of toxic events associated with bortezomib and melphalan\textendash prednisone. Grade 3 events occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the bortezomib group than in the control group (53\% vs. 44\%, P\,=\,0.02), but there were no significant differences in grade 4 events (28\% and 27\%, respectively) or treatment-related deaths (1\% and 2\%). Conclusions Bortezomib plus melphalan\textendash prednisone was superior to melphalan\textendash prednisone alone in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma who were ineligible for high-dose therapy.

  abstract = {PURPOSE The goal of this study is to identify and compare all direct costs of intravenous and subcutaneous rituximab given to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the Netherlands.  METHODS Using a prospective, observational, bottom-up microcosting study, we collected primary data on the direct medical costs of the preparation, administration, and acquisition of rituximab. Drug costs and costs of drug wastage, labor costs, material costs, and outpatient costs were identified using standardized forms, structured using prices from official pricelists, and compared for the intravenous and subcutaneous forms of rituximab.  FINDINGS Measurements were taken on 53 rituximab administrations (33 intravenous and 20 subcutaneous) and on 13 rituximab preparation (7 intravenous and 6 subcutaneous). The mean total costs were \texteuro 2176.77 for the intravenous infusion and \texteuro 1911.09 for the subcutaneous injection. The estimated difference of \texteuro 265.17 (95\% CI, \texteuro 231.99\textendash `\texteuro 298.35) per administration was mainly attributable to differences in time spent in the chemotherapy unit, related outpatient costs, drug wastage, and drug costs.  IMPLICATIONS Rituximab administered in the form of subcutaneous injection is less costly than its intravenous form. With their equal effectiveness taken into account, subcutaneous rituximab administration can result in significant savings when transferred to the total diffuse large B-cell lymphoma population in the Netherlands.},

Posttransplantation risks of acute GVHD and leukemia relapse were defined in Asian/Pacific Islander, white, African American, Hispanic, and Native American patients that underwent transplantation from donors with the same self-described background. Asian patients had a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD (Japanese patients: 40.0\% grades II to IV and 15.3\% grades III to IV; non-Japanese Asian patients: 42.1\% grades II to IV and 15.7\% grades III to IV) compared with white patients (56.5\% grades II to IV and 22.6\% grades III to IV) (P~\&lt;~.001). The hazard ratio of acute GVHD for white patients was significantly higher than for Japanese patients. Unexpectedly, the hazard ratio of leukemia relapse in white patients with early disease status was also significantly higher than that in Japanese patients. These results provide a platform for future investigation into the genetic factors for unrelated donor HCT and clinical implications of diverse ethnic background.},

B-cell depletion therapy using monoclonal antibodies against CD20, such as rituximab, has revolutionized the treatment of these disorders, greatly improving overall survival in patients. Here, we report the development of GA101 as the first Fc-engineered, type II humanized IgG1 antibody against CD20. Relative to rituximab, GA101 has increased direct and immune effector cell-mediated cytotoxicity and exhibits superior activity in cellular assays and whole blood B-cell depletion assays. In human lymphoma xenograft models, GA101 exhibits superior antitumor activity, resulting in the induction of complete tumor remission and increased overall survival. In nonhuman primates, GA101 demonstrates superior B cell-depleting activity in lymphoid tissue, including in lymph nodes and spleen. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the development of GA101 as a promising new therapy for the treatment of B-cell disorders.},

  abstract = {In this study, we reviewed pharmacoeconomic guidelines from the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Australia, Canada, and the United States to determine areas of emerging standardization. We examined the published literature, publication guidelines of major health journals, and published and unpublished recommendations from various task forces and conferences on related topics. The review revealed several general principles for which there was consensus across guidelines. These common features included the importance of using and reporting transparent methods so that readers can easily understand what calculations are being performed on which data elements, minimizing bias, and providing justification for the methods and assumptions used. Differences were detected across guidelines on the following topics: type of pharmacoeconomic assessment, perspective, comparators and data sources, data analysis, cost analysis, future cost analysis, outcomes assessment, modeling, time horizon, discounting, disclosure, and generalizability. Evolution of economic guidelines hinges on whether the primary goal is to increase the consistency or increase the validity of economic assessments. Some balance between these two objectives is desirable.},

  abstract = {Purpose Aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (aNHL) is associated with poor long-term survival after relapse, and treatment is limited by a lack of consensus regarding standard of care. Pixantrone was studied in a randomized trial in patients with relapsed or refractory aNHL who had failed {$\geq$}2 lines of therapy, demonstrating a significant improvement in complete or unconfirmed complete response and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with investigators' choice of single-agent therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the health economic implications of pixantrone versus current clinical practice (CCP) in the United Kingdom for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aNHL receiving their third or fourth line of treatment. Methods A semi-Markov partition model based on overall survival and PFS was developed to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of treatment of multiply relapsed or refractory aNHL with pixantrone versus CCP. The empirical overall survival and PFS data from the PIX301 trial were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon. Resource use was elicited from clinical experts, and unit costs and utilities were obtained from published sources. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom's National Health Service and personal social services. Outcomes evaluated were total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty around the results. Findings Pixantrone was estimated to increase life expectancy by a mean of 10.8 months per patient compared with CCP and a mean gain of 0.56 discounted QALYs. The increased health gains were associated with an increase in discounted costs of approximately \textsterling 18,494 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pixantrone versus CCP was \textsterling 33,272 per QALY gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses suggest that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to uncertainty in the PFS and overall survival estimates and the utility values associated with each health state. Implications Pixantrone may be considered both clinically effective and cost-effective for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aNHL who currently have a high level of unmet need.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2009, a new version of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) was introduced with five rather than three answer levels per dimension. This instrument is known as the EQ-5D-5L. To make the EQ-5D-5L suitable for use in economic evaluations, societal values need to be attached to all 3125 health states. OBJECTIVES: To derive a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L. METHODS: Health state values were elicited during face-to-face interviews in a general population sample stratified for age, sex, and education, using composite time trade-off (cTTO) and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Data were modeled using ordinary least squares and tobit regression (for cTTO) and a multinomial conditional logit model (for DCE). Model performance was evaluated on the basis of internal consistency, parsimony, goodness of fit, handling of left-censored values, and theoretical considerations. RESULTS: A representative sample (N = 1003) of the Dutch population participated in the valuation study. Data of 979 and 992 respondents were included in the analysis of the cTTO and the DCE, respectively. The cTTO data were left-censored at -1. The tobit model was considered the preferred model for the tariff on the basis of its handling of the censored nature of the data, which was confirmed through comparison with the DCE data. The predicted values for the EQ-5D-5L ranged from -0.446 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L on the basis of cTTO. The values represent the preferences of the Dutch population. The tariff can be used to estimate the impact of health care interventions on quality of life, for example, in context of economic evaluations.},

  abstract = {Background Existing reports of utility values for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) vary quite widely and are not all suitable for use in submissions in the UK. The aim of this study was to elicit UK societal based utility values for different stages of NSCLC and different grade III-IV toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapy treatments. Toxicities included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, rash and hair loss. Methods Existing health state descriptions of metastatic breast cancer were revised to make them suitable as descriptions of metastatic NSCLC patients on second-line treatment. The existing health states were used in cognitive debrief interviews with oncologists (n = 5) and oncology specialist nurses (n = 5). Changes were made as suggested by the clinical experts. The resulting health states (n = 17) were piloted and used in a societal based valuation study (n = 100). Participants rated half of the total health states in a standard gamble interview to derive health state utility scores. Data were analysed using a mixed model analysis. Results Each health state described the symptom burden of disease and impact on different levels of functioning (physical, emotional, sexual, and social). The disutility related to each disease state and toxicity was estimated and were combined to give health state values. All disease states and toxicities were independent significant predictors of utility (p {$<$} 0.001). Stable disease with no toxicity (our base state) had a utility value of 0.653. Utility scores ranged from 0.673 (responding disease with no toxicity) to 0.473 for progressive disease. Conclusion This study reflects the value that society place on the avoidance of disease progression and severe toxicities in NSCLC.},

Each regulatory agency has elaborated an original regulatory framework and adopted regulatory projects developed by the other regulatory agencies.

In addition, the necessity of the product being first development in Japan is the original feature of the Sakigake designation, while actively supporting the development of advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) by academia or small/medium-sized sponsors is the original feature of the PRIME; these particular features are different from the breakthrough therapy designation in the US. In this review article, flexible and expedited review processes for new drugs, and cell and gene therapies in the US, the EU, and Japan are described.

  abstract = {Students of Markov decision models are often taught to add a half-cycle's worth of incremental utility to the cumulative total for each health state. The reason for this "half-cycle correction'' is often illustrated by a graph of the proportion of the hypothetical Markov cohort remaining in a given state. The ideal graph is shown as a smooth, declining, curve that represents the transition of patients randomly throughout each cycle. On the same graph, the effect of the accounting of state membership at the end of each cycle in discrete, computer-based approximations of the ideal Markov process is shown. Students are able to clearly see that the cumulative incremental utility in the discrete case underestimates the desired quantity. Likewise, they find the concept of shifting the ideal curve to the right by one-half cycle to reduce the latter discrepancy to be intuitive. However, students often find the approximate equivalence of shifting the ideal state membership curve and adding a half-cycle's worth of incremental utility to the total for the state at the beginning of a discrete Markov process to be a difficult cognitive leap. This article describes 2 pedagogical devices, algebraic and intuitive/visual approaches, that may assist the instructor of Markov theory to convey the latter concept. Elements of adult learning theory are discussed, which may help the instructor to choose which approach to employ. Implementation of the half-cycle correction in commonly used decision-analytic software is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) remains the second leading cause of death following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT). Over the last five years, the progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this immune based-process helped redefine graft versus host reaction and opened new possibilities for novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. The evolution in the field of immunology widened the horizons for hematopoietic stem cell transplant leading to the availability of different stem cell sources for potential graft and incorporation of novel conditioning regimens. There is conflicting data about the impact of the graft source and the conditioning regimen used in the process of AHSCT on the incidence of aGVHD. Many studies have reported increased risk of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and to a less extent aGVHD with the use of peripheral blood stem cell and bone marrow compared to umbilical cord stem cell. The conditioning regimen, either myeloablative, non-myeloablative or reduced intensity may have different impact on the incidence of GVHD. Several preventive modalities have been adopted by different transplant centers but, to date, there is no standardized regimen. As for treatment, immunosuppression using steroids remains the first line of intervention. Several novel therapeutic options are being investigated for treatment of steroid-refractory aGVHD including the use of mesenchymal stem cells, anti thymocyte globulin and extra corporeal photophoresis. This review discusses the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical features, and advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of aGVHD.},

  abstract = {Objectives To explore the effectiveness of data sharing by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in journals with a full data sharing policy and to describe potential difficulties encountered in the process of performing reanalyses of the primary outcomes. Design Survey of published RCTs. Setting PubMed/Medline. Eligibility criteria RCTs that had been submitted and published by The BMJ and PLOS Medicine subsequent to the adoption of data sharing policies by these journals. Main outcome measure The primary outcome was data availability, defined as the eventual receipt of complete data with clear labelling. Primary outcomes were reanalyzed to assess to what extent studies were reproduced. Difficulties encountered were described. Results 37 RCTs (21 from The BMJ and 16 from PLOS Medicine) published between 2013 and 2016 met the eligibility criteria. 17/37 (46\%, 95\% confidence interval 30\% to 62\%) satisfied the definition of data availability and 14 of the 17 (82\%, 59\% to 94\%) were fully reproduced on all their primary outcomes. Of the remaining RCTs, errors were identified in two but reached similar conclusions and one paper did not provide enough information in the Methods section to reproduce the analyses. Difficulties identified included problems in contacting corresponding authors and lack of resources on their behalf in preparing the datasets. In addition, there was a range of different data sharing practices across study groups. Conclusions Data availability was not optimal in two journals with a strong policy for data sharing. When investigators shared data, most reanalyses largely reproduced the original results. Data sharing practices need to become more widespread and streamlined to allow meaningful reanalyses and reuse of data. Trial registration Open Science Framework osf.io/c4zke.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Survival extrapolation using a single, best-fit model ignores 2 sources of model uncertainty: uncertainty in the true underlying distribution and uncertainty about the stability of the model parameters over time. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has been used to account for the former, but it can also account for the latter. We investigated BMA using a published comparison of the Charnley and Spectron hip prostheses using the original 8-year follow-up registry data. METHODS: A wide variety of alternative distributions were fitted. Two additional distributions were used to address uncertainty about parameter stability: optimistic and skeptical. The optimistic (skeptical) model represented the model distribution with the highest (lowest) estimated probabilities of survival but reestimated using, as prior information, the most optimistic (skeptical) parameter estimated for intermediate follow-up periods. Distributions were then averaged assuming the same posterior probabilities for the optimistic, skeptical, and noninformative models. Cost-effectiveness was compared using both the original 8-year and extended 16-year follow-up data. RESULTS: We found that all models obtained similar revision-free years during the observed period. In contrast, there was variability over the decision time horizon. Over the observed period, we detected considerable uncertainty in the shape parameter for Spectron. After BMA, Spectron was cost-effective at a threshold of \textsterling 20,000 with 93\% probability, whereas the best-fit model was 100\%; by contrast, with a 16-year follow-up, it was 0\%. CONCLUSIONS: This case study casts doubt on the ability of the single best-fit model selected by information criteria statistics to adequately capture model uncertainty. Under this scenario, BMA weighted by posterior probabilities better addressed model uncertainty. However, there is still value in regularly updating health economic models, even where decision uncertainty is low.},

Many, if not most published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) have not used a true societal perspective. Further, decision-making bodies that have incorporated CEA into health technology assessment to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions have not adopted a societal perspective. Given this backdrop and various options, the Second Panel recommends that all studies report two Reference Case analyses: one based on a healthcare sector perspective and one based on a societal perspective. We recommend that analysts present all items in an analysis as disaggregated consequences in an Impact Inventory to ensure that all consequences, including those outside the formal healthcare sector, are considered regularly and comprehensively, as they have generally not been to date.},

Only articles published in English between 1990 and May 7, 2007, and including individuals of all ages with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting adherence to medications using self-report, pill counts, medication possession ratios, and electronic monitoring devices were included. Database analyses of prescription records from various organizations or countries were included only if adherence to pharmaco-logic therapy was stated. Surveys and questionnaires assessing medication taking were also included. The data from the selected literature was abstracted independently.

  abstract = {Aims Obinutuzumab (GA101; G) is a new treatment for follicular lymphoma (FL) that is anticipated to have greater efficacy than the current treatment, rituximab (R). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of G plus chemotherapy (G + Chemo) against that of R plus chemotherapy (R + Chemo) for patients in Japan with previously untreated FL. Materials and methods We localized a previously reported cost-effectiveness model using the Japanese cost data. For estimating costs adapted in the model, FL patients treated with R were identified from Japanese hospital-based claims database and classified into three treatment regimen groups according to chemotherapies used with R: CHOP, CVP, and bendamustine (B). Based on services per patient and cost items, parameters determining the cost amounts were derived using a multivariate generalized linear mixed model to estimate the direct medical costs for each treatment regimen group for G and R. For the utility, same values in the previous model were used. Lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated under the payer's perspective. Results The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in million JPY per QALY for G-CHOP vs. R-CHOP, G-CVP vs. R-CVP, and G-B vs. R-B were 5.4, 4.3, and 4.8, respectively. ICERs were lower than 7.5 million JPY per QALY, which is the cost-effectiveness threshold for cancer treatments, and showed that G + Chemo is a cost-effective treatment regimen for Japanese patients with previously untreated FL. Lifetime direct medical costs were lowest in the R-B group because hospitalization costs that accounted for most of the total cost were lowest in this group. Limitations and conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of G + Chemo is acceptable in Japan. Differences in the direct medical costs among treatment regimen groups were mostly due to hospitalization costs. This is probably because many Japanese hematologists choose inpatient treatments over outpatient treatments in CHOP-based induction therapy.},

The analyses were based on clinical trials CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02, from the perspective of the National Health System. The alternatives compared were the treatment with lenalidomide against maintenance without treatment (MwT). Efficiency measures used were years of life gained (YGs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). According to the CALGB 100104 trial data, the average health costs of patients who were treated with lenalidomide for 120 months was \texteuro 836,534.31 and without treatment was \texteuro 528,963.63. The effectiveness of the lenalidomide group was 7.59YGs (5.72 QALY) against 6.58 of MwT (4.61 QALY). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was \texteuro 277,456.72/QALY and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \texteuro 303,191.05/YGs. From the analysis, the IFM2005-02 trial obtained 5.13 QALY in the lenalidomide group against the 4.98 QALY in the MwT group, with an ICUR of \texteuro 1,502,780.55/QALY. In terms of budgetary impact, a range between 799 and 1452 patients susceptible to receive treatment with lenalidomide was assumed in Spain. In conclusion, the results show a high ICUR and budgetary impact, which adds uncertainty about the maximum prudent duration of the treatment.},

  abstract = {Time is an important aspect of health economic evaluation, as the timing and duration of clinical events, healthcare interventions and their consequences all affect estimated costs and effects. These issues should be reflected in the design of health economic models. This article considers three important aspects of time in modelling: (1) which cohorts to simulate and how far into the future to extend the analysis; (2) the simulation of time, including the difference between discrete-time and continuous-time models, cycle lengths, and converting rates and probabilities; and (3) discounting future costs and effects to their present values. We provide a methodological overview of these issues and make recommendations to help inform both the conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses and the interpretation of their results. For choosing which cohorts to simulate and how many, we suggest analysts carefully assess potential reasons for variation in cost effectiveness between cohorts and the feasibility of subgroup-specific recommendations. For the simulation of time, we recommend using short cycles or continuous-time models to avoid biases and the need for half-cycle corrections, and provide advice on the correct conversion of transition probabilities in state transition models. Finally, for discounting, analysts should not only follow current guidance and report how discounting was conducted, especially in the case of differential discounting, but also seek to develop an understanding of its rationale. Our overall recommendations are that analysts explicitly state and justify their modelling choices regarding time and consider how alternative choices may impact on results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A common way of describing UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) decisions is to distinguish between cases where NICE recommended use of a healthcare technology by all relevant patients ('yes'); those where it did not recommend use ('no'); and those where its decisions are a mixture of 'yes' to some patient subgroups, and 'no' to others. Over half of NICE's decisions are of this mixed type, which involve restricting (or 'optimizing') patient use in some way. OBJECTIVE: To report an attempt to develop a robust and defensible means of measuring and describing the degree of patient access in mixed NICE decisions. METHODS: A list of mixed decisions made from 2006 to the end of 2009 was identified using HTAinSite. The following calculation was used: M = (p/P) x 100, where M is a measure of the level of patient access (0 = no access, 100 = full access), P is the set of patients considered in the guidance as Potential candidates for treatment (given the licensed use and the scope of NICE's appraisal), and p is a subset of those patients, for whom NICE did recommend treatment. M can be estimated either for a specific product or for a group of technologies (Multiple Technology Appraisals). Both product-specific and overall M were estimated, using estimates of p obtained from NICE costing templates. These data are subject to some important limitations, so the results should be regarded as illustrative. RESULTS: Of the 69 medicines that have received a mixed decision since January 2006, 34 included details that allowed the estimation of M. Of these 34 decisions, 24 (71\%) had a product-specific M},

However, there is limited information available to describe the course of therapy (COT) that patients receive following FL diagnosis. Methods: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry \& Medicare claims dataset, we analyzed patients 66 years and older diagnosed with FL from 2000 to 2011. In order to characterize FL treatments, we identified first, second and subsequent-lines of therapy listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 2.2016. We identified the first COT (COT1) as the first regimen that a patient receives after diagnosis. We identified the second and third COT (COT2 and COT3) as new treatment received following/interrupting COT1 or COT2, respectively. Using visual analytics software, we investigated and reported the proportion of patients receiving each COT, the top three regimens within each COT, and the median time to starting a COT from diagnosis or end of a previous COT. Results: 10,836 FL patients were identified after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Sixty-two percent (N=6,756) of the patients received FL-directed treatment. Among patients receiving COT1, 65\% received COT2. Among patients receiving COT2, 79\% received COT3. The table below provides additional information on the COT received. Conclusions: Analysis of real-world data indicates that almost 4 out of 10 elderly FL patients do not receive the listed FL-directed treatments. In contrast to rituximab, there was limited use of RCHOP and RCVP after COT1 during the study period. Additional research is needed to understand the differences across demographic groups and associated health outcomes.

  abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B cell malignancy accounting for 1\textendash 2\% of all adult lymphomas. Treatment with dose-intensive, multi-agent chemotherapy is effective but associated with considerable toxicity. In this observational study, we compared real-world efficacy, toxicity, and costs of four frequently employed treatment strategies for Burkitt lymphoma: the Lymphome Malins B (LMB), the Berlin-Frankfurt-M\"unster (BFM), the HOVON, and the CODOX-M/IVAC regimens. We collected data from 147 adult patients treated in eight referral centers. Following central pathology assessment, 105 of these cases were accepted as Burkitt lymphoma, resulting in the following treatment groups: LMB 36 patients, BFM 19 patients, HOVON 29 patients, and CODOX-M/IVAC 21 patients (median age 39~years, range 14\textendash 74; mean duration of follow-up 47~months). There was no significant difference between age, sex ratio, disease stage, or percentage HIV-positive patients between the treatment groups. Five-year progression-free survival (69\%, p~=~0.966) and 5-year overall survival (69\%, p~=~0.981) were comparable for all treatment groups. Treatment-related toxicity was also comparable with only hepatotoxicity seen more frequently in the CODOX/M-IVAC group (p~=~0.004). Costs were determined by the number of rituximab gifts and the number of inpatients days. Overall, CODOX-M/IVAC had the most beneficial profile with regards to costs, treatment duration, and percentage of patients completing planned treatment. We conclude that the four treatment protocols for Burkitt lymphoma yield nearly identical results with regards to efficacy and safety but differ in treatment duration and costs. These differences may help guide future choice of treatment.},

Patients and Methods Six hundred forty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of an every 21-days cycle, or the same bortezomib regimen with PLD 30 mg/m2 on day 4.   Results Median time to progression was increased from 6.5 months for bortezomib to 9.3 months with the PLD + bortezomib combination (P = .000004; hazard ratio, 1.82 [monotherapy v combination therapy]; 95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.35). The 15-month survival rate for PLD + bortezomib was 76\% compared with 65\% for bortezomib alone (P = .03). The complete plus partial response rate was 41\% for bortezomib and 44\% for PLD + bortezomib, a difference that was not statistically significant. Median duration of response was increased from 7.0 to 10.2 months (P = .0008) with PLD + bortezomib. Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent in the combination group (80\% v 64\%), with safety profiles consistent with the known toxicities of the two agents. An increased incidence in the combination group was seen of grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome.   Conclusion PLD with bortezomib is superior to bortezomib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The combination therapy is associated with a higher incidence of grade 3/4 myelosuppression, constitutional symptoms, and GI and dermatologic toxicities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous results from an interim analysis of an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study demonstrated that bortezomib combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was superior to bortezomib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had previously received one or more lines of therapy. Protocol-defined final survival data from that study are provided here. METHODS Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either bortezomib alone (1.3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of every 21-day cycle) or bortezomib-PLD (bortezomib plus PLD 30 mg/m2 intravenously on day 4). The primary endpoint was the time to progression. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and the overall response rate. RESULTS In total, 646 patients (bortezomib-PLD, n = 324; bortezomib alone, n = 322) were randomized between December, 2004, and March, 2006. On the clinical cutoff date (May 16, 2014) for the final survival analysis, at a median follow-up of 103 months, 79\% of patients had died (bortezomib-PLD group: 253 of 324 patients; 78\%; bortezomib alone group: 257 of 322 patients; 80\%). The median OS in the bortezomib-PLD group was 33 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 28.9\textendash 37.1) versus 30.8 months (95\% CI, 25.2\textendash 36.5) in the bortezomib alone group (hazard ratio, 1.047; 95\% CI, 0.879\textendash 1.246; P = .6068). Salvage therapies included conventional and novel drugs, which were well balanced between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Despite inducing a superior time to progression, long-term follow-up revealed that PLD-bortezomib did not improve OS compared with bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The inability to sustain the early observed survival advantage may have been caused by the effects of subsequent lines of therapy, and underscores the need for long-term follow-up of phase 3 trials while recognizing the challenge of having adequate power to detect long-term differences in OS.},

The closing of borders, the reduction of people transit and the confinement of the population has affected the supply chains of this live-saving medical product. The aim of this mini-review is to focus on how COVID-19 pandemic have affected CAR T-cell therapy, considering the differences between the large-scale centralized productions in the field of the pharmaceutical industry versus the product manufacturing in the academic/hospital environment. We also review different aspects of CAR T-cell therapy and our experience managing them, including patient selection, resource prioritization and some practical aspects to consider for the safe administration. Although hospitals have been forced to change their usual workflows to cope with the saturation of hospitalized patients, we recommend centers to continue offering this potentially curative treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Thus, appropriate selection criteria, early intervention to attenuate neurotoxicity or cytokine release syndrome with tocilizumab, and prophylactic/preventive strategies to prevent infection are discussed. These considerations may apply to other emerging adoptive cell treatments and the corresponding manufacturing processes.},

  abstract = {Relapse is the main reason for treatment failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite improvements in the up-front therapy, survival after relapse is still relatively poor, especially for high-risk relapses. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes following acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse after common initial Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology protocol treatment; to validate currently used risk stratifications, and identify additional prognostic factors for overall survival. Altogether, 516 of 2735 patients (18.9\%) relapsed between 1992 and 2011 and were included in the study. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between the up-front protocols or between the relapse protocols used, but an improvement over time was observed. The 5-year overall survival for patients relapsing in the period 2002-2011 was 57.5{$\pm$}3.4\%, but 44.7{$\pm$}3.2\% (P{$<$}0.001) if relapse occurred in the period 1992-2001. Factors independently predicting mortality after relapse included short duration of first remission, bone marrow involvement, age ten years or over, unfavorable cytogenetics, and Down syndrome. T-cell immunophenotype was not an independent prognostic factor unless in combination with hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis. The outcome for early combined pre-B relapses was unexpectedly poor (5-year overall survival 38.0{$\pm$}10.6\%), which supports the notion that these patients need further risk adjustment. Although survival outcomes have improved over time, the development of novel approaches is urgently needed to increase survival in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to discuss issues surrounding the conduct of "piggyback evaluations," in which health-economic data are collected within an otherwise typical clinical trial. METHODS: We review the methodologic literature on piggyback economic evaluations, as well as selected empiric studies. We summarize the challenges encountered in the conduct of these studies, alternative ways of addressing these challenges, and their future role in pharmacoeconomic research. RESULTS: Piggyback evaluations have certain advantages over other types of pharmacoeconomic studies. An economic evaluation can benefit from the experimental design that maximizes the trial's internal validity, and it is often more practical to collect economic data alongside a trial rather than to fund a stand-alone economic study. However, piggyback evaluations are subject to problems deriving from the competing nature of clinical versus economic study objectives, which can give rise to tension in such fundamental aspects of study design as the selection of study subjects and sites; the extent of protocol-mandated health-care services; and the determination of sample size, length of follow-up, and the study comparator(s). Many solutions have been put forth in the literature to address these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Piggyback evaluations can be an appropriate means to measure the economic impact of medical interventions, provided that the methodologic challenges are acknowledged and addressed within the context of each individual study. As long as a desire for patient-level data from clinical trials exists, there will be a need for piggyback economic evaluations in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease ({$\geq$}10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease ({$<$}10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% CI 25{$\cdot$}9-45{$\cdot$}9) in the idarubicin group versus 64{$\cdot$}6\% (54{$\cdot$}2-73{$\cdot$}2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0{$\cdot$}0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45{$\cdot$}2\% (34{$\cdot$}5-55{$\cdot$}3) versus 69{$\cdot$}0\% (58{$\cdot$}5-77{$\cdot$}3; p=0{$\cdot$}004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0{$\cdot$}56, 0{$\cdot$}34-0{$\cdot$}92, p=0{$\cdot$}007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0{$\cdot$}52, 0{$\cdot$}24-1{$\cdot$}11, p=0{$\cdot$}11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

  abstract = {Pediatric Hematology Oncology as a specialty was possible because of the evolution of the science of Hematology, which developed microscopy for describing blood cell morphology and methods for quantitation of these elements. Before pediatric blood diseases could be defined, it was necessary to establish the normal blood values of infancy and childhood. The unique features of the blood of the newborn were the focus of many of the early studies. After normal values were established, specific blood disease and hematologic syndromes of children began to be described in Europe and the United States. Pediatric Hematology Oncology is a broad and complex area that encompasses perturbations of the several-formed elements of the blood and their precursors in the bone marrow, as well as the coagulation-fibrinolytic systems in the plasma, the reticuloendothelial system, and malignancies of the blood and solid tissues and organs. The interactions of the blood and nutrition have long been important areas of study. Advances in Pediatric Oncology have been particularly spectacular in the last 50 years. Using multi-modal therapy including combination chemotherapy, more than 80\% of children with cancer can now be cured. During the last 50 years, Pediatric Hematology Oncology has increasingly used tools of the ``new biology'': immunology, biochemistry, enzymology, genetics and molecular genetics, and others. During the last century, many diseases have been recognized and defined by biochemical and genetic mechanisms, and in some instances they have been prevented or cured.},

However, treatment costs and bleeding risks are higher, and there is another treatment option for peripheral arterial disease, 75?mg clopidogrel. A comprehensive assessment of benefits, risks and costs of dual pathway inhibition versus standard of care is needed.MethodsWe used a state transition model including cardiovascular, ischaemic limb and bleeding events to compare dual pathway inhibition to aspirin antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease, and additionally to clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy in peripheral arterial disease patients. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from costs and quality-adjusted life-years of lifelong treatment, and the cost-effectiveness probability at a ?50,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold.ResultsQuality-adjusted life-years and costs of dual pathway inhibition were highest, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios versus aspirin were ?32,109 in coronary artery disease and ?26,381 in peripheral arterial disease patients, with 92\% and 56\% cost-effectiveness probability, respectively (clopidogrel was extendedly dominated). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below ?20,000 in comorbid peripheral arterial disease patients and coronary artery disease patients younger than 65 years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were above ?50,000 in carotid artery disease patients and coronary artery disease patients older than 75 years.ConclusionLifelong preventive treatment of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease patients at risk of cardiovascular events with dual pathway inhibition improves health outcomes and seems overall cost-effective relative to aspirin antiplatelet therapy and also to clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy for peripheral arterial disease, particularly in comorbid patients, but not in older patients and in carotid artery disease patients. These findings may warrant a targeted approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship between disease activity and health functioning, as measured by a range of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 222 patients with FL were recruited from eight sites across the UK and they completed a number of PRO measures. The participants were analyzed across five disease states: 'active disease-newly diagnosed', 'active disease-relapsed', 'partial response', 'complete response' and 'disease free'. The relationship between these disease states and their level of health functioning was assessed as well as the relationship between being 'on' or 'off' chemotherapy and disease state. RESULTS: In terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), participants in the relapsed category had the lowest mean physical well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and social well-being score. In a regression analysis, the 'active disease-relapsed' group acted as a significant predictor for each PRO variable. In addition, the remission group acted as a significant predictor of high anxiety scores as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that various aspects of patient-reported health outcomes differ according to disease state in patients with FL. For those patients who have relapsed, they are more likely to experience worse HRQoL and other patient-reported health outcomes than patients newly diagnosed, in partial or complete remission or when completely disease free.},

  abstract = {Standard methods for indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis are based on aggregate data, with the key assumption that there is no difference between the trials in the distribution of effect-modifying variables. Methods which relax this assumption are becoming increasingly common for submissions to reimbursement agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These methods use individual patient data from a subset of trials to form population-adjusted indirect comparisons between treatments, in a specific target population. Recently proposed population adjustment methods include the Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and the Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC). Despite increasing popularity, MAIC and STC remain largely untested. Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity about exactly how and when they should be applied in practice, and even whether the results are relevant to the decision problem. There is therefore a real and present risk that the assumptions being made in one submission to a reimbursement agency are fundamentally different to\textemdash or even incompatible with\textemdash the assumptions being made in another for the same indication. We describe the assumptions required for population-adjusted indirect comparisons, and demonstrate how these may be used to generate comparisons in any given target population. We distinguish between anchored and unanchored comparisons according to whether a common comparator arm is used or not. Unanchored comparisons make much stronger assumptions, which are widely regarded as infeasible. We provide recommendations on how and when population adjustment methods should be used, and the supporting analyses that are required to provide statistically valid, clinically meaningful, transparent and consistent results for the purposes of health technology appraisal. Simulation studies are needed to examine the properties of population adjustment methods and their robustness to breakdown of assumptions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trial discontinuation and nonpublication represent potential waste in research resources and lead to compromises in medical evidence. Pediatric trials may be particularly vulnerable to these outcomes given the challenges encountered in conducting trials in children. We aimed to determine the prevalence of discontinuation and nonpublication of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in pediatric populations. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of pediatric RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2008 to 2010. Data were collected from the registry and associated publications identified (final search on September 1, 2015). RESULTS: Of 559 trials, 104 (19\%) were discontinued early, accounting for an estimated 8369 pediatric participants. Difficulty with patient accrual (37\%) was the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation. Trials were less likely to be discontinued if they were funded by industry compared with academic institutions (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.27\textendash 0.77). Of the 455 completed trials, 136 (30\%) were not published, representing 69 165 pediatric participants. Forty-two unpublished trials posted results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials funded by industry were more than twice as likely to result in nonpublication at 24 and 36 months (OR 2.21, 95\% CI 1.35\textendash 3.64; OR 3.12, 95\% CI 1.6\textendash 6.08, respectively) and had a longer mean time to publication compared with trials sponsored by academia (33 vs 24 months, P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric RCTs, discontinuation and nonpublication were common, with thousands of children exposed to interventions that did not lead to informative or published findings. Trial funding source was an important determinant of these outcomes, with both academic and industry sponsors contributing to inefficiencies.},

  abstract = {Background Reliable estimates of populations affected by diseases are necessary to guide efficient allocation of public health resources. Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) is the most common and clinically significant haemoglobin structural variant, but no contemporary estimates exist of the global populations affected. Moreover, the precision of available national estimates of heterozygous (AS) and homozygous (SS) neonates is unknown. We aimed to provide evidence-based estimates at various scales, with uncertainty measures. Methods Using a database of sickle haemoglobin surveys, we created a contemporary global map of HbS allele frequency distribution within a Bayesian geostatistical model. The pairing of this map with demographic data enabled calculation of global, regional, and national estimates of the annual number of AS and SS neonates. Subnational estimates were also calculated in data-rich areas. Findings Our map shows subnational spatial heterogeneities and high allele frequencies across most of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and India, as well as gene flow following migrations to western Europe and the eastern coast of the Americas. Accounting for local heterogeneities and demographic factors, we estimated that the global number of neonates affected by HbS in 2010 included 5\hphantom{,}476\hphantom{,}000 (IQR 5\hphantom{,}291\hphantom{,}000\textendash 5\hphantom{,}679\hphantom{,}000) AS neonates and 312\hphantom{,}000 (294\hphantom{,}000\textendash 330\hphantom{,}000) SS neonates. These global estimates are higher than previous conservative estimates. Important differences predicted at the national level are discussed. Interpretation HbS will have an increasing effect on public health systems. Our estimates can help countries and the international community gauge the need for appropriate diagnoses and genetic counselling to reduce the number of neonates affected. Similar mapping and modelling methods could be used for other inherited disorders. Funding The Wellcome Trust.},

For this reason, oncological research is putting a lot of effort towards finding new and efficient therapies which can alleviate critical side effects caused by conventional treatments. Different technologies are currently under evaluation in clinical trials or have been already introduced into clinical practice. While nanomedicine is contributing to the development of biocompatible materials both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, bioengineering of extracellular vesicles and cells derived from patients has allowed designing ad hoc systems and univocal targeting strategies. In this review, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the most innovative advances in basic and applied cancer research.},

  abstract = {The term drug reimbursement describes the policy system that determines whether or not a drug is entitled to reimbursement within the healthcare system. Countries make different decisions regarding which cancer treatments to routinely provide. As a result, depending on the cancer drug-indication and the country assessing it, the decision can be Favourable, Favourable with restrictions or Non-Favourable. The main objective of this paper is to describe the differences in drug reimbursement decisions on cancer drugs across 10 European countries. This aim is achieved through testing a number of hypotheses that can explain the differences in these specific reimbursement decisions. First of all, we collect data on cancer drug decisions for 10 European countries, from 2002 to 2014. Secondly, the hypotheses are tested on this database. The results show that Social Health Insurance systems tend to take more Favourable decisions than the tax-based systems, that cost-effective drug-indications have a higher probability of reimbursement and that other countries are more likely to make a Favourable decision if NICE also make it. Moreover, our findings also corroborate that an economic evaluation requirement reduces the number of Favourable decisions, and that, during the global financial crisis, the number of Favourable decisions has been reduced, compared to Non-Favourable and restricted. To sum up, characteristics of the drug reimbursement system, drug particularities and the socioeconomic situation are the main factors determining the differences across countries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adulthood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disease. In contrast to childhood ALL, survival for adults with ALL is poor. Recently, new protocols, including use of pediatric protocols in young adults, have improved survival in clinical trials. Here, we examine population level survival in Germany and the United States (US) to gain insight into the extent to which changes in clinical trials have translated into better survival on the population level. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in the US and 11 cancer registries in Germany. Patients age 15\textendash 69 diagnosed with ALL were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS). RESULTS: Overall 5-year RS was estimated at 43.4\% for Germany and 35.5\% for the US (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.004), with a decrease in survival with increasing age. Survival was higher in Germany than the US for men (43.6\% versus 37.7\%, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002) but not for women (42.4\% versus 40.3\%, p{$>$}0.1). Five-year RS estimates increased in Germany and the US between 2002 and 2006 by 11.8 and 7.3 percent units, respectively (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.02 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Survival for adults with ALL continues to be low compared with that for children, but a substantial increase in 5-year survival estimates was seen from 2002 to 2006 in both Germany and the US. The reasons for the survival differences between both countries require clarification.},

The process of shared development and local experimentation resulted in EQ-5D, a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care and in population health surveys. Currently, EQ-5D is being widely used in different countries by clinical researchers in a variety of clinical areas. EQ-5D is also being used by eight out of the first 10 of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies listed in the annual report of Pharma Business (November/December 1999).

  abstract = {The EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire is used worldwide as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument for the measurement and valuation of health. Several variants of the instrument now exist, including versions with three and five levels of severity and one for respondents aged 8 to 14 years. From the outset, a demand for new language versions of the EQ-5D questionnaire meant that there was a need to implement standardized procedures, which ensured that such versions were produced following international recommendations for the cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcomes. The availability of new variants and formats of the instrument, such as telephone-administered or electronic formats, complicated the task of providing and controlling the quality of cultural adaptations. Although cultural adaptations of the instrument are widely used, the procedures currently used to produce them have not been widely disseminated. The present article therefore describes the evolution of the production of other language versions of the instrument from the earliest days of simultaneous production and translation of the EQ-5D questionnaire to the more recent, broader-based strategy of version management. We describe current adaptation procedures and innovations within those procedures. We also describe how version management is organized within the EuroQol Group, review aspects related to quality control, and provide an overview of the number of currently available language versions for each variant of the EQ-5D questionnaire: three-level, five-level, and youth versions. We conclude by discussing some of the relevant issues related to cultural adaptation for frequently used instruments such as the EQ-5D questionnaire.},

Mean HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a period of 5 years following diagnosis. Total costs of treatment were determined from variables in administrative databases in a universally accessible and publicly funded healthcare system. Valid HRQL assessments (n\,=\,1200) were collected for 307 BFM and 317 DFCI patients, with costs measured for 66 BFM and 28 DFCI patients. QALYs per patient were {$<$}1.0\% greater for BFM than DFCI. Median HRQL scores revealed no difference in QALYs. The difference in mean total costs for BFM (US\$88\,480) and DFCI (US\$93\,026) was not significant (P\,=\,0.600). This study provides no evidence of superiority for one treatment strategy over the other. Current BFM or DFCI strategies should represent conventional management for the next economic evaluation of treatments for ALL in childhood.},

The Evidence Review Group (ERG), the School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield, produced a document summarising the key points from the company submission alongside a critical review. Efficacy for progression-free survival (PFS) and safety was positively demonstrated in the pivotal GADOLIN trial, which compared obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance (O-Benda+O) against bendamustine monotherapy. Data on overall survival were immature. The company submitted a model-based economic analysis, including a patient access scheme. The ERG identified a number of limitations, in particular the absence of subgroup analysis and the approach used by the company to estimate overall survival (OS), which was more favourable to the intervention arm. The key uncertainty was the duration of the treatment effect on OS. This uncertainty is expected to be reduced when the final analysis of the GADOLIN trial is reported. Consequently, the NICE appraisal committee recommended O-Benda+O in the population covered by the marketing authorisation within the Cancer Drug Fund until NICE is able to review the guidance following publication of the final analysis of GADOLIN.},

At diagnosis, the presence of Bcl-2/IgH-positive cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) was demonstrated in all patients (n = 128) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Patients who achieved a clinical response following CHOP but remained PCR-positive were eligible for rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously, weekly for 4 weeks). After CHOP, 57\% achieved a complete response (CR), 37\% a partial response (PR), and 6\% were nonresponders (NR). At this stage, patients proving PCR-negative (n = 41) or failing to achieve a clinical response (n = 8) were excluded from rituximab treatment. Seventy-seven patients received rituximab and entered a scheduled MRD follow-up program. At the first molecular follow-up (+12 weeks), 59\% had converted to PCR negativity in the BM and PB, with a further increase documented at the second control (+28 weeks) with 74\% PCR negative. At the last molecular follow-up (+44 weeks), 63\% of the patients remained PCR negative. At 3 years, the estimated overall survival of all patients is 95\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 86-98). For patients achieving PCR-negative status following CHOP and therefore excluded from rituximab treatment, freedom from recurrence (FFR) was 52\% (95\% CI, 28-71). For patients treated with rituximab, a durable PCR-negative status was associated with a better clinical outcome since FFR was 57\% (95\% CI, 23-81) compared with 20\% (95\% CI, 4-46) in patients who never achieved or lost the molecular negativity (P {$<$}.001).},

Furthermore, the current centralized production paradigm for the T cells is less than satisfactory. Therefore, several countries are exploring alternative T-cell production modes. Our study is based on the T-cell production experience in a nonprofit setting in Germany. We first identified the work steps and main activities in the production process. Then we determined the fixed costs and variable costs. Main cost components included personnel and technician salaries, expenditure on equipment, a clean room, as well as production materials. All costs were calculated in 2018 euros and converted into U.S. dollars. For a clean room with one machine for closed and automated manufacturing installed, annual fixed costs summed up to approximately \texteuro 438 098 (\$584 131). The variable cost per production was roughly \texteuro 34 798 (\$46 397). At the maximum capacity of one machine, total cost per product would be close to \texteuro 60 000 (\$78 849). As shown in the scenario analysis, if three machines were to be installed in the clean room, per production cost could be as low as \texteuro 45 000 (roughly \$59905). If a cheaper alternative to lentivirus was used, per production total cost could be further reduced to approximately \texteuro 33 000 (roughly \$44309). Decentralized T-cell production might be a less costly and more efficient alternative to the current centralized production mode that requires a high acquisition cost.},

  abstract = {Which costs and benefits to consider in economic evaluations of healthcare interventions remains an area of much controversy. Unrelated medical costs in life-years gained is an important cost category that is normally ignored in economic evaluations, irrespective of the perspective chosen for the analysis. National guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research largely endorse this practice, either by explicitly requiring researchers to exclude these costs from the analysis or by leaving inclusion or exclusion up to the discretion of the analyst. However, the inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life-years gained appears to be gaining support in the literature.This article provides an overview of the discussions to date. The inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life-years gained seems warranted, in terms of both optimality and internal and external consistency. We use an example of a smoking-cessation intervention to highlight the consequences of different practices of accounting for costs and effects in economic evaluations. Only inclusion of all costs and effects of unrelated medical care in life-years gained can be considered both internally and externally consistent. Including or excluding unrelated future medical costs may have important distributional consequences, especially for interventions that substantially increase length of life. Regarding practical objections against inclusion of future costs, it is important to note that it is becoming increasingly possible to accurately estimate unrelated medical costs in life-years gained. We therefore conclude that the inclusion of unrelated medical costs should become the new standard.},

  abstract = {Introduction Evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks intend to ensure that all criteria of relevance to a health decision are systematically considered. This paper, part of a series commissioned by the WHO, reports on the development of an EtD framework that is rooted in WHO norms and values, reflective of the changing global health landscape, and suitable for a range of interventions and complexity features. We also sought to assess the value of this framework to decision-makers at global and national levels, and to facilitate uptake through suggestions on how to prioritise criteria and methods to collect evidence. Methods In an iterative, principles-based approach, we developed the framework structure from WHO norms and values. Preliminary criteria were derived from key documents and supplemented with comprehensive subcriteria obtained through an overview of systematic reviews of criteria employed in health decision-making. We assessed to what extent the framework can accommodate features of complexity, and conducted key informant interviews among WHO guideline developers. Suggestions on methods were drawn from the literature and expert consultation. Results The new WHO-INTEGRATE (INTEGRATe Evidence) framework comprises six substantive criteria\textemdash balance of health benefits and harms, human rights and sociocultural acceptability, health equity, equality and non-discrimination, societal implications, financial and economic considerations, and feasibility and health system considerations\textemdash and the meta-criterion quality of evidence. It is intended to facilitate a structured process of reflection and discussion in a problem-specific and context-specific manner from the start of a guideline development or other health decision-making process. For each criterion, the framework offers a definition, subcriteria and example questions; it also suggests relevant primary research and evidence synthesis methods and approaches to assessing quality of evidence. Conclusion The framework is deliberately labelled version 1.0. We expect further modifications based on focus group discussions in four countries, example applications and input across concerned disciplines.},

Study Design and Setting SRs from high-impact general internal medicine journals were reviewed for search quality characteristics and reporting quality by independent reviewers using three instruments, including a checklist of Institute of Medicine Recommended Standards for the Search Process and a scored modification of the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies instrument. Results The level of librarian and information specialist participation was significantly associated with search reproducibility from reported search strategies ({$X$}2~=~23.5; P~\&lt;~0.0001). Librarian co-authored SRs had significantly higher odds of meeting 8 of 13 analyzed search standards than those with no librarian participation and six more than those with mentioned librarian participation. One-way ANOVA showed that differences in total search quality scores between all three groups were statistically significant (F2,267~=~10.1233; P~\&lt;~0.0001). Conclusion Problems remain with SR search quality and reporting. SRs with librarian or information specialist co-authors are correlated with significantly higher quality reported search strategies. To minimize bias in SRs, authors and editors could encourage librarian engagement in SRs including authorship as a potential way to help improve documentation of the search strategy.},

  abstract = {Purpose Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, is a promising alternative for the management of children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective intervention compared with salvage chemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL in Spain. Materials and Methods A partitioned survival model of monthly cycles with three health states was used (event-free survival, progressive/relapsed disease and death). A lifetime time horizon and the Spanish National Health System perspective were adopted. During the first 5 years, permanence in the different health states was determined according to the results in the clinical studies. In successive years, mortality tables of the Spanish general population adjusted by standardized mortality rate for survivors of childhood cancer were used. Clinical, economic, and quality of life parameters were drawn from clinical trials and the literature. Only direct health costs (pharmacological costs and the costs derived from health resource use) were included. The robustness of the results was evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. Results This cost-effectiveness analysis showed a greater benefit (10.10 and 8.97 life-years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained, respectively) and a higher cost (\texteuro{} 258,378.40) for tisagenlecleucel compared to salvage chemotherapy. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were \texteuro{} 25,576.80 per LYG and \texteuro{} 28,818.52 per QALY gained, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, all the results were below \texteuro{} 50,000/QALY. Conclusion Tisagenlecleucel would represent a cost-effective intervention for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r ALL in Spain.},

  abstract = {Background: Many economic studies of disease require cost data at the person level to identify diagnosed cases and to capture the type and timing of specific services. One source of cost data is claims and other administrative records associated with health insurance programs and health care providers. Objective: To describe and compare strengths and limitations of various administrative and claims databases. Data and Methods: Data sources included claims and enrollment records from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers; Veterans' Health Administration records; state hospital discharge datasets; Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project hospital databases; managed care plan data systems; and provider cost reports. Claims provide information on payments, whereas cost reports yield resource costs incurred to produce services. Administrative data may be significantly augmented by linkage to disease registries and surveys. Results: Administrative data are often available for large, enrolled populations, have detailed information on individual service use, and can be aggregated by service type, episode, and patient. Service use and costs can often be tracked longitudinally. Because they are not collected for research purposes, administrative data can be difficult to access and use. Limitations include generalizability, complexity, coverage and benefit restrictions, and lack of coverage continuity. Linked datasets permit identification of incident cases of disease, and analyses of health care costs by stage at diagnosis, phase of care, comorbidity status, income, and insurance status. Conclusions: Administrative data are an essential source of information for studies of the financial burden of disease. Cost estimates can vary substantially by specific measures (payments, charges, cost to charge ratios) and across data sources.},

  abstract = {The appropriate development of a model begins with understanding the problem that is being represented. The aim of this article is to provide a series of consensus-based best practices regarding the process of model conceptualization. For the purpose of this series of papers, the authors consider the development of models whose purpose is to inform medical decisions and health-related resource allocation questions. They specifically divide the conceptualization process into two distinct components: the conceptualization of the problem, which converts knowledge of the health care process or decision into a representation of the problem, followed by the conceptualization of the model itself, which matches the attributes and characteristics of a particular modeling type to the needs of the problem being represented. Recommendations are made regarding the structure of the modeling team, agreement on the statement of the problem, the structure, perspective and target population of the model, and the interventions and outcomes represented. Best practices relating to the specific characteristics of model structure, and which characteristics of the problem might be most easily represented in a specific modeling method, are presented. Each section contains a number of recommendations that were iterated among the authors, as well as the wider modeling taskforce, jointly set up by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Stagnant outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 15 to 39 years old) with cancer are partly attributed to poor enrollment onto clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) was developed to improve clinical trial participation in the community setting, where AYAs are most often treated. Further, many CCOP sites had pediatric and medical oncologists with collaborative potential for AYA recruitment and care. For these reasons, we hypothesized that CCOP sites enrolled proportionately more AYAs than non-CCOP sites onto Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials. Methods: For the 10-year period 2004 through 2013, the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention database was queried to evaluate enrollments into relevant COG studies. The proportional enrollment of AYAs at CCOP and non-CCOP sites was compared and the change in AYA enrollment patterns assessed. All sites were COG member institutions. Results: Although CCOP sites enrolled a higher proportion of patients in cancer control studies than non-CCOP sites (3.5\% v 1.8\%; P {$<$} .001), they enrolled a lower proportion of AYAs (24.1\% v 28.2\%, respectively; P {$<$} .001). Proportional AYA enrollment at CCOP sites decreased during the intervals 2004 through 2008 and 2009 through 2013 (26.7\% v 21.7\%; P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: Despite oncology practice settings that might be expected to achieve otherwise, CCOP sites did not enroll a larger proportion of AYAs in clinical trials than traditional COG institutions. Our findings suggest that the CCOP (now the NCI Community Oncology Research Program) can be leveraged for developing targeted interventions for overcoming AYA enrollment barriers.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was recently approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) following two or more prior therapies. As the first CAR T-cell therapy available for adults in the US, there are important questions about clinical and economic value. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of axi-cel compared to salvage chemotherapy using a decision model and a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: A decision model was developed to estimate life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime cost for adult patients with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel vs salvage chemotherapy (R-DHAP). Patient-level analyses of the ZUMA-1 and SCHOLAR-1 studies were used to inform the model and to estimate the proportion achieving long-term survival. Drug and procedure costs were derived from US average sales prices and Medicare reimbursement schedules. Future healthcare costs in long-term remission was derived from per capita Medicare spending. Utility values were derived from patient-level data from ZUMA-1 and external literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. Outcomes were calculated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3\% per year. Results: In the base case, LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 9.5, 7.7, and \$552,921 for axi-cel vs 2.6, 1.1, and \$172,737 for salvage chemotherapy, respectively. The axi-cel cost per QALY gained was \$58,146. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the fraction achieving long-term remission, discount rate, and axi-cel price. The likelihood that axi-cel is cost-effective was 95\% at a willingness to pay of \$100,000 per QALY. Conclusion: Axi-cel is a potentially cost-effective alternative to salvage chemotherapy for adults with R/R LBCL. Long-term follow-up is necessary to reduce uncertainties about health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer.},

  abstract = {This article reviews approaches to pharmaceutical pricing in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain to inform better understanding of the role of external reference pricing and its relevance to the UK., External reference pricing, or international price comparison, is a common strategy to control prices of pharmaceuticals that are protected by intellectual property rights and benefit from a legal monopoly (in-patent drugs). In the UK negotiations are under way that seek to define new arrangements for the pricing of branded (new) medicines from 2014. The pharmaceutical market in the UK only accounts for a small proportion of global sales; however, UK prices are important as many countries reference their prices against those in the UK. This article seeks to contribute to our understanding of approaches to pharmaceutical pricing in high-income countries and the role of reference pricing as a means to determining pharmaceutical prices. Reviewing experiences in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, we find high variability of external reference pricing across different settings and of the relative importance of this approach in comparison with other pricing strategies. There was also considerable variation in the terminology and practices used, and understanding the complexities of countries included in reference baskets for external pricing requires considerable semantic clarification. There was considerable overlap between countries that cross-reference, and it remains challenging to estimate the direct, immediate impact on external reference baskets. This review suggests that the international impact of pricing changes in the UK is likely to be minimal or indirect, largely because of the diverse ways in which reference pricing is implemented in the countries examined.},

  abstract = {Evidence-based medicine, whose philosophical origins extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the proficiency and judgment that we individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increased expertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more effective and efficient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available external clinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient centered clinical research into the accuracy and precision of diagnostic tests (including the clinical examination), the power of prognostic markers, and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventive regimens. External clinical evidence both invalidates previously accepted diagnostic tests and treatment and replaces them with new ones that are more powerful, more accurate, more efficacious, and safer. Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by external evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best external evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of life-long, self-directed learning in which caring for our own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and other clinical and health care issues, and in which we (1) convert these information needs into answerable questions; (2) track down, with maximum efficiency, the best evidence with which to answer them (whether from the clinical examination, the diagnostic laboratory from research evidence, or other sources); (3) critically appraise that evidence for its validity (closeness to the truth) and usefulness (clincial applicability); (4) integrate this appraisal with our clinical expertise and apply it in practice; and (5) evaluate our performance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with follicular lymphoma can have long survival times, but disease progression typically occurs 3-5 years after initial treatment. We assessed the potential benefit of 2 years of rituximab maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma receiving a rituximab plus chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: The randomised, open-label PRIMA study was undertaken in 223 centres in 25 countries. 1217 patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma needing systemic therapy received one of three non-randomised immunochemotherapy induction regimens used in routine practice. 1019 patients achieving a complete or partial response were then randomly assigned to receive 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy (375 mg/m(2) every 8 weeks) or observation. Treatment was assigned equally by centralised block randomisation, stratified by induction regimen, response, region, and centre. Neither the participants nor those giving the interventions, assessing outcomes, and analysing data were masked to group assignments. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00140582. FINDINGS: 505 patients were assigned to rituximab maintenance and 513 to observation (one patient died during randomisation). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 30-42), PFS was 74.9\% (95\% CI 70.9-78.9) in the rituximab maintenance group (130 patients progressed) and 57.6\% (53.2-62.0) in the observation group (218 progressed; hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95\% CI 0.44-0.68, p{$<$}0.0001). 2 years after randomisation, 361 patients (71.5\%) in the rituximab maintenance group were in complete or unconfirmed complete response versus 268 (52.2\%) in the observation group (p=0.0001). Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.51-1.47). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were recorded in 121 patients (24\%) in the rituximab maintenance group and 84 (17\%) in the observation group (risk ratio 1.46, 95\% CI 1.14-1.87; p=0.0026). Infections (grades 2-4) were the most common adverse event, occurring in 197 (39\%) and 123 (24\%) patients, respectively (risk ratio 1.62, 95\% CI 1.35-1.96; p{$<$}0.0001). INTERPRETATION: 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy after immunochemotherapy as first-line treatment for follicular lymphoma significantly improves PFS.

  abstract = {The intergroup PRIMA Phase III study was designed to investigate the potential benefit of 2-years of rituximab maintenance in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) responding to one of three non-randomised first line immunochemotherapy treatments. The results of the final analysis with 36 months follow-up (Salles et al., Lancet 2011) demonstrated a significant reduction of the risk of progression or death with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55 in favour of patients randomized to rituximab maintenance. We present here the updated results with 3 additional years of follow-up. From December 2004 until April 2007, 1217 patients were enrolled from 223 centres and complete data were available for 1193 patients who had the following pre-induction treatment characteristics: median age 56 years [range 22-87]; 52\% male; 90\% Ann Arbor stage III-IV; 33\% B symptoms; 56\% bone marrow involvement; 4\% ECOG performance status {$>$}1; 34\% elevated LDH; 32\% beta2-microglobulin {$>$}3mg/L; FLIPI score 0-1 (21\%), FLIPI 2 (36\%), FLIPI 3-5 (43\%). Most patients (75\%) received R-CHOP induction (22\% R-CVP, 3\% R-FCM). Patients responding to induction therapy were stratified based on their immunochemotherapy regimen and response [CR/CRu versus PR] and randomized to observation or rituximab maintenance, 1 infusion (375 mg/m2) every 8 weeks for 2 years. A total of 1018 randomised patients were analyzed according to the ITT principle (513 observation / 505 rituximab maintenance). All initial pre-treatment characteristics were well balanced between arms and the response status at time of randomization was CR=39\%; CRu=32\% and PR=28\% (others 1\%). With a median follow-up of 73 months from randomization, 6-year progression free survival estimate was 42.7\% (95\% CI 38 - 46.9\%) in the observation arm (284 events, median=48 months) and 59.2\% (95\% CI 54.7 - 63.7\%) in the rituximab maintenance arm (194 events, median not reached), respectively (stratified Log-Rank, P{$<$}. 0001; HR = 0.58 ; 95\% CI 0.48 - 0.69). In pre-planned analyses of patients subgroups categorized by age, sex, FLIPI score category, induction chemotherapy and response to induction, the effect of rituximab maintenance was examined and found to be consistent among these different subgroups. In a Cox regression multivariate analysis, rituximab maintenance (HR=0.57; P{$<$}.0001) as well as older age (HR=0.79; P=.015), female sex (HR=0.72; P=.0003) and low or intermediate FLIPI groups (HR=0.67; P{$<$}.0001) were all significant variables associated with superior progression free survival. A significant reduction in the risk of starting a new anti-lymphoma treatment (HR=0.63, 95\% CI 0.52 - 0.76) or starting a new chemotherapy (HR=0.70, 95\% CI 0.57 - 0.86) were also observed for rituximab maintenance. The rate of histological transformation did not appear to differ between the 2 treatment arms: in the observation arm, transformation was documented in 24 patients (114 cases with morphological documentation out of 278 progressions) versus 16 patients in the rituximab maintenance arm (80 out of 186) respectively. Overall response rate to second-line therapy was reported by investigators to be 180/227 (79\%) in patients from the observation arm (CR/CRu=61\%; PR=19\%) versus 109/144 (76\%) in patients from the rituximab maintenance arm (CR/CRu =51\%; PR=22\%) (P=NS). At the time of the data cut-off, overall survival (OS) remains favourable in both study arms: 58 patients (11.3\%) have died in the observation arm (6-years OS estimate 88.7\%) compared to 59 patients (11.7\%) in the rituximab maintenance arm (6-year OS estimate 87,4\%). Main causes documented for death in the observation and rituximab maintenance arm respectively were lymphoma (28 ; 28), other malignancy (19 ; 5) and infections (4 ; 7). No new significant safety data were captured with this additional follow-up period. In conclusion, with 3 additional years of follow-up, these data demonstrate a sustained and persistent benefit of 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy after immunochemotherapy, resulting in improved progression free survival.

  abstract = {Objective Various statistical methods have been developed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) from published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for the purpose of performing meta-analyses. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability, accuracy, and precision of four commonly used methods by Guyot, Williamson, Parmar, and Hoyle and Henley. Design Pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in oncology were identified from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) database (primary analysis) and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug approvals page (secondary analysis) between January 2012 and May 2016. Two reviewers independently reconstructed HRs using each method on KM curves extracted from each trial and compared them with reported HRs (gold standard). Bland-Altman plots and summary statistics were calculated to assess accuracy and precision of these methods. Interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). These four methods were also applied to KM curves of different structures (ie, flat versus steep curves). Results A total of 118 KM curves (55 RCTs) and 77 KM curves (46 RCTs) were extracted from pCODR and FDA, respectively. In the primary analysis, the Guyot method was the most accurate with the lowest mean error (0.0094; 95\% CI, -0.0012-0.020). All four methods had excellent interrater reliability. The Guyot method showed the smallest bias and greatest precision on the Bland-Altman plots. The Guyot method was consistently superior in both the secondary and all sensitivity analyses. Conclusion In the absence of reported HRs, we recommend that researchers consider the Guyot method to reconstruct HRs from KM curves when performing aggregate data meta-analyses.},

Although MEDLINE provides excellent coverage of health science evidence, it has proved challenging to achieve high levels of recall through Boolean searches alone. Methods Recall of one Boolean search method, the Clinical Query, combined with a ranking method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) or PubMed Related Articles, was tested against a gold standard of studies added to 6 updated Cochrane reviews, and 10 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Reviews. For the AHRQ sample, precision and temporal stability was examined for each method. Results Recall of new studies was 0.69 for the Clinical Query, 0.66 for Related Articles, and 0.50 for SVM, 0.91 for the combination of Clinical Query and Related Articles and 0.89 for the combination of Clinical Query and SVM. Precision was 0.11 for Clinical Query and Related Articles combined, and 0.11 for Clinical Query and SVM combined. Related Articles showed least stability over time. Conclusions The complementary combination of a Boolean search strategy and a ranking strategy appears to provide a robust method for identifying relevant studies in MEDLINE.},

  abstract = {Background Panobinostat is a potent oral pan-deacetylase inhibitor that in preclinical studies has synergistic anti-myeloma activity when combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone. We aimed to compare panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone with placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Methods PANORAMA1 is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial of patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received between one and three previous treatment regimens. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web-based and voice response system, stratified by number of previous treatment lines and by previous use of bortezomib, to receive 21 day cycles of placebo or panobinostat (20 mg; on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, orally), both in combination with bortezomib (1{$\cdot$}3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11, intravenously) and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, orally). Patients, physicians, and the investigators who did the data analysis were masked to treatment allocation; crossover was not permitted. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (in accordance with modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria and based on investigators' assessment) and was analysed by intention to treat. The study is ongoing, but no longer recruiting, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01023308. Findings 768 patients were enrolled between Jan 21, 2010, and Feb 29, 2012, with 387 randomly assigned to panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and 381 to placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. Median follow-up was 6{$\cdot$}47 months (IQR 1{$\cdot$}81\textendash 13{$\cdot$}47) in the panobinostat group and 5{$\cdot$}59 months (2{$\cdot$}14\textendash 11{$\cdot$}30) in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the panobinostat group than in the placebo group (11{$\cdot$}99 months [95\% CI 10{$\cdot$}33\textendash 12{$\cdot$}94] vs 8{$\cdot$}08 months [7{$\cdot$}56\textendash 9{$\cdot$}23]; hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}63, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}52\textendash 0{$\cdot$}76; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Overall survival data are not yet mature, although at the time of this analysis, median overall survival was 33{$\cdot$}64 months (95\% CI 31{$\cdot$}34\textendash not estimable) for the panobinostat group and 30{$\cdot$}39 months (26{$\cdot$}87\textendash not estimable) for the placebo group (HR 0{$\cdot$}87, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}69\textendash 1{$\cdot$}10; p=0{$\cdot$}26). The proportion of patients achieving an overall response did not differ between treatment groups (235 [60{$\cdot$}7\%, 95\% CI 55{$\cdot$}7\textendash 65{$\cdot$}6] for panobinostat vs 208 [54{$\cdot$}6\%, 49{$\cdot$}4\textendash 59{$\cdot$}7] for placebo; p=0{$\cdot$}09); however, the proportion of patients with a complete or near complete response was significantly higher in the panobinostat group than in the placebo group (107 [27{$\cdot$}6\%, 95\% CI 23{$\cdot$}2\textendash 32{$\cdot$}4] vs 60 [15{$\cdot$}7\%, 12{$\cdot$}2\textendash 19{$\cdot$}8]; p=0{$\cdot$}00006). Minimal responses were noted in 23 (6\%) patients in the panobinostat group and in 42 (11\%) in the placebo group. Median duration of response (partial response or better) was 13{$\cdot$}14 months (95\% CI 11{$\cdot$}76\textendash 14{$\cdot$}92) in the panobinostat group and 10{$\cdot$}87 months (9{$\cdot$}23\textendash 11{$\cdot$}76) in the placebo group, and median time to response (partial response or better) was 1{$\cdot$}51 months (1{$\cdot$}41\textendash 1{$\cdot$}64) in the panobinostat group and 2{$\cdot$}00 months (1{$\cdot$}61\textendash 2{$\cdot$}79) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 228 (60\%) of 381 patients in the panobinostat group and 157 (42\%) of 377 patients in the placebo group. Common grade 3\textendash 4 laboratory abnormalities and adverse events (irrespective of association with study drug) included thrombocytopenia (256 [67\%] in the panobinostat group vs 118 [31\%] in the placebo group), lymphopenia (202 [53\%] vs 150 [40\%]), diarrhoea (97 [26\%] vs 30 [8\%]), asthenia or fatigue (91 [24\%] vs 45 [12\%]), and peripheral neuropathy (67 [18\%] vs 55 [15\%]). Interpretation Our results suggest that panobinostat could be a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Longer follow up will be necessary to determine whether there is any effect on overall survival. Funding Novartis Pharmaceuticals.},

Here, we present the final overall survival analysis for this trial. METHODS: PANORAMA 1 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial of patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with one to three previous treatments. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive panobinostat (20 mg orally) or placebo, with bortezomib (1{$\cdot$}3 mg/m2 intravenously) and dexamethasone (20 mg orally), over two distinct treatment phases. In treatment phase 1 (eight 3-week cycles), patients received: panobinostat or placebo on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12; bortezomib on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. During treatment phase 2 (four 6-week cycles with a 2 weeks on, 1 week off schedule), panobinostat or placebo was given three times a week, bortezomib was administered once a week, and dexamethasone was given on the days of and following bortezomib administration. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival; overall survival was a key secondary endpoint. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01023308. FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2010, and Feb 29, 2012, 768 patients were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to receive either panobinostat (n=387) or placebo (n=381), plus bortezomib and dexamethasone. At data cutoff (June 29, 2015), 415 patients had died. Median overall survival was 40{$\cdot$}3 months (95\% CI 35{$\cdot$}0-44{$\cdot$}8) in those who received panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone versus 35{$\cdot$}8 months (29{$\cdot$}0-40{$\cdot$}6) in those who received placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}94, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}78-1{$\cdot$}14; p=0{$\cdot$}54). Of patients who had received at least two previous regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug, median overall survival was 25{$\cdot$}5 months (95\% CI 19{$\cdot$}6-34{$\cdot$}3) in 73 patients who received panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone versus 19{$\cdot$}5 months (14{$\cdot$}1-32{$\cdot$}5) in 74 who received placebo (HR 1{$\cdot$}01, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}68-1{$\cdot$}50). INTERPRETATION: The overall survival benefit with panobinostat over placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone was modest. However, optimisation of the regimen could potentially prolong treatment duration and improve patients' outcomes, although further trials will be required to confirm this.

  abstract = {Background Few effective treatments exist for patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma not responding to treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide. Pomalidomide alone has shown limited efficacy in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, but synergistic effects have been noted when combined with dexamethasone. We compared the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone with high-dose dexamethasone alone in these patients. Methods This multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial was undertaken in Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they had been diagnosed with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and had failed at least two previous treatments of bortezomib and lenalidomide. They were assigned in a 2:1 ratio with a validated interactive voice and internet response system to either 28 day cycles of pomalidomide (4 mg/day on days 1\textendash 21, orally) plus low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, orally) or high-dose dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1\textendash 4, 9\textendash 12, and 17\textendash 20, orally) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were age ({$\leq$}75 years vs {$>$}75 years), disease population (refractory vs relapsed and refractory vs bortezomib intolerant), and number of previous treatments (two vs more than two). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01311687, and with EudraCT, number 2010-019820-30. Findings The accrual for the study has been completed and the analyses are presented. 302 patients were randomly assigned to receive pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and 153 high-dose dexamethasone. After a median follow-up of 10{$\cdot$}0 months (IQR 7{$\cdot$}2\textendash 13{$\cdot$}2), median PFS with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was 4{$\cdot$}0 months (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}6\textendash 4{$\cdot$}7) versus 1{$\cdot$}9 months (1{$\cdot$}9\textendash 2{$\cdot$}2) with high-dose dexamethasone (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}48 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}39\textendash 0{$\cdot$}60]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The most common grade 3\textendash 4 haematological adverse events in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethasone groups were neutropenia (143 [48\%] of 300 vs 24 [16\%] of 150, respectively), anaemia (99 [33\%] vs 55 [37\%], respectively), and thrombocytopenia (67 [22\%] vs 39 [26\%], respectively). Grade 3\textendash 4 non-haematological adverse events in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethasone groups included pneumonia (38 [13\%] vs 12 [8\%], respectively), bone pain (21 [7\%] vs seven [5\%], respectively), and fatigue (16 [5\%] vs nine [6\%], respectively). There were 11 (4\%) treatment-related adverse events leading to death in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone group and seven (5\%) in the high-dose dexamethasone group. Interpretation Pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone, an oral regimen, could be considered a new treatment option in patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

  abstract = {We used multiple regression models to assess the influence of disease stage at diagnosis on the 5-year relative survival of 4,478 patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990\textendash 1992. The cases were representative samples from 17 population-based cancer registries in 6 European countries (Estonia, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and UK) that were combined into 9 regional groups based on similar survival. Five-year relative survival was 79\% overall, varying from 98\% for early, node-negative (T1N0M0) tumours; 87\% for large, node-negative (T2-3N0M0) tumours; 76\% for node-positive (T1-3N+M0) tumours and 55\% for locally advanced (T4NxM0) tumours to 18\% for metastatic (M1) tumours and 69\% for tumours of unspecified stage. There was considerable variation across Europe in relative survival within each disease stage, but this was least marked for early node-negative tumours. Overall 5-year relative survival was highest in the French group of Bas-Rhin, C\^ote d'Or, H\'erault and Is\`ere (86\%), and lowest in Estonia (66\%). These geographic groups were characterised by the highest and lowest percentages of women with early stage disease (T1N0M0: 39\% and 9\%, respectively). The French, Dutch and Italian groups had the highest percentage of operated cases. The number of axillary nodes examined, a factor influencing nodal status, was highest in Italy and Spain. After adjusting for TNM stage and the number of nodes examined, survival differences were greatly reduced, indicating that for these women, diagnosed with breast cancer in Europe during 1990\textendash 1992, the survival differences were mainly due to differences in stage at diagnosis. However, in 3 regional groups, the relative risks of death remained high even after these adjustments, suggesting less than optimal treatment. Screening for breast cancer did not seem to affect the survival patterns once stage had been taken into account. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a new class of cancer therapy with promising results, but comes at a high upfront cost. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy among pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: We built a microsimulation model for pediatric patients with r/r ALL who received either CAR-T therapy or standard of care chemotherapy. Outcomes modeled included costs, quality of life (health utility), treatment complications, and survival, all of which were estimated from published literature. Long-term survival beyond the timeframe of clinical trial data was estimated using Social Security actuarial life-tables adjusted with standardized mortality ratios. Cost-effectiveness was measured with the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under \$100,000 per qualityadjusted life year (QALY) considered cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess overall stability of the model. Results: Compared to standard of care chemotherapy CAR-T increased the total cost of treatment by \$378,600 and increased effectiveness by 6.72 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of \$56,300 per QALY. The model was sensitive to assumptions about long-term CAR-T survival, the cost of CAR-T, and duration of IVIG required in CAR-T responders. The base model assumed a 79\% one-year survival with CAR-T therapy, though if the one-year survival decreased to 61\% then the ICER of CAR-T increased above \$100,000 per QALY. If the cost of CAR-T infusion increased from \$475,000 to \$781,000, or if the duration of IVIG infusions extend beyond 12 years then the ICER of CAR-T therapy increased above \$100,000 per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis CAR-T was cost-effective in {$>$} 99\% of iterations at a willingness to pay of \$100,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Despite its high cost, CAR-T therapy has an acceptable cost-effectiveness profile for pediatric r/r ALL. Additional follow-up of this cohort is required to establish long-term outcomes and further inform questions about the costeffectiveness of CAR-T therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Although the life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) has increased, little is known of their causes of death (CODs) in the rituximab era. PATIENTS AND METHODS We pooled two cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with FL grade 1-3A. Patients were enrolled between 2001 and 2013 in two French referral institutions (N = 734; median follow-up 89 months) and 2002 and 2012 in the University of Iowa and Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE; N = 920; median follow-up 84 months). COD was classified as being a result of lymphoma, other malignancy, treatment related, or all other causes. RESULTS Ten-year overall survival was comparable in the French (80\%) and US (77\%) cohorts. We were able to classify COD in 248 (88\%) of 283 decedents. In the overall cohort, lymphoma was the most common COD, with a cumulative incidence of 10.3\% at 10 years, followed by treatment-related mortality (3.0\%), other malignancy (2.9\%), other causes (2.2\%), and unknown (3.0\%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of death as a result of lymphoma or treatment was higher than death as a result of all other causes for each age group (including patients {$\geq$} 70 years of age at diagnosis [25.4\% v 16.6\%]) Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 3 to 5 (27.4\% v 5.2\%), but not Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 0 to 1 (4.0\% v 3.7\%); for patients who failed to achieve event-free survival within 24 months from diagnosis (36.1\% v 7.0\%), but not for patients who achieved event-free survival within 24 months of diagnosis (6.7\% v 5.7\%); and for patients with a history of transformed FL (45.9\% v 4.7\%), but not among patients without (8.1\% v 6.2\%). Overall, 77 of 140 deaths as a result of lymphoma occurred in patients whose FL transformed after diagnosis. CONCLUSION Despite the improvement in overall survival in patients with FL in the rituximab era, their leading COD remains lymphoma, especially after disease transformation. Treatment-related mortality also represents a concern, which supports the need for less-toxic therapies.},

  abstract = {Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) have been used in the assessment of health interventions for three decades. The popularity of the QALY approach has been constantly increasing, although the debate on its theoretical underpinnings and practical implications is still ongoing. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), also widely debated, were shaped some 20 years later, broadly within the same conceptual framework but with a number of important differences.This paper provides a comprehensive formulation of QALY calculation methods, offering practical instruments for assessing the impact of health interventions, similar to those made available elsewhere for calculating DALYs. Systematic differences between QALYs and DALYs are explained by reference to two examples: the prevention of tuberculosis and the treatment of bipolar depression. When a health intervention is aimed at preventing or treating a non-fatal disease, the relationship between QALYs gained and DALYs saved depends on age of onset and duration of the disease, as well as the quality of life and disability weights. In the case of a potentially fatal disease, a larger number of factors may determine differences between outcomes assessed with the two metrics. The relative importance of some of these factors is discussed and illustrated graphically in the paper. Understanding similarities and differences between QALYs and DALYs is important to researchers and policy makers, for a sound interpretation of the evidence on the outcomes of health interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma who fail to achieve adequate disease control with rituximab-based treatment have few treatment options and a poor prognosis. We aimed to assess a combination of obinutuzumab (GA101), a novel glyco-engineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and bendamustine in this patient population. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 study (GADOLIN), patients aged 18 years or older with histologically documented, CD20-positive indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma refractory to rituximab were enrolled at 83 hospital and community sites in 14 countries in Europe, Asia, and North and Central America. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a hierarchical dynamic randomisation scheme stratified by indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, rituximab-refractory type, number of previous therapies, and geographical region, to receive induction treatment (six 28-day cycles) with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine or bendamustine monotherapy, both given intravenously. Obinutuzumab plus bendamustine dosing was obinutuzumab 1000 mg (days 1, 8, and 15, cycle 1; day 1, cycles 2-6) plus bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) per day (days 1 and 2, cycles 1-6), and bendamustine monotherapy dosing was 120 mg/m(2) per day (days 1 and 2, all cycles). Non-progressing patients in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group received obinutuzumab maintenance (1000 mg every 2 months) for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in all randomised patients, as assessed by an independent review committee. Safety was assessed in all patients who received any amount of obinutuzumab or bendamustine. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01059630, and has stopped recruiting patients. FINDINGS: Between April 15, 2010, and Sept 1, 2014, when the study was stopped after a pre-planned interim analysis, 396 patients were randomly assigned (194 to obinutuzumab plus bendamustine and 202 to bendamustine monotherapy). After a median follow-up time of 21{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 12{$\cdot$}1-31{$\cdot$}0) in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and 20{$\cdot$}3 months (9{$\cdot$}5-29{$\cdot$}7) in the bendamustine monotherapy group, progression-free survival was significantly longer with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine (median not reached [95\% CI 22{$\cdot$}5 months-not estimable]) than with bendamustine monotherapy (14{$\cdot$}9 months [12{$\cdot$}8-16{$\cdot$}6]; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}55 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}40-0{$\cdot$}74]; p=0{$\cdot$}0001). Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 132 (68\%) of 194 patients in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and in 123 (62\%) of 198 patients in the bendamustine monotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (64 [33\%] in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group vs 52 [26\%] in the bendamustine monotherapy group), thrombocytopenia (21 [11\%] vs 32 [16\%]), anaemia (15 [8\%] vs 20 [10\%]) and infusion-related reactions (21 [11\%] vs 11 [6\%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 74 patients (38\%) in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and in 65 patients (33\%) in the bendamustine monotherapy group, and deaths due to adverse events occurred in 12 patients (6\%) and 12 patients (6\%), respectively. Three (25\%) of 12 adverse event-related deaths in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and five (42\%) of 12 in the bendamustine monotherapy group were treatment related. INTERPRETATION: Obinutuzumab plus bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance has improved efficacy over bendamustine monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with manageable toxicity, and is a new treatment option for patients who have relapsed after or are no longer responding to rituximab-based therapy.

This tool was applied to 99 paper-based and 52 electronic systematic reviews. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify underlying components. The results were considered by methodological experts using a nominal group technique aimed at item reduction and design of an assessment tool with face and content validity.RESULTS:The factor analysis identified 11 components. From each component, one item was selected by the nominal group. The resulting instrument was judged to have face and content validity.CONCLUSION:A measurement tool for the 'assessment of multiple systematic reviews' (AMSTAR) was developed. The tool consists of 11 items and has good face and content validity for measuring the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Additional studies are needed with a focus on the reproducibility and construct validity of AMSTAR, before strong recommendations can be made on its use.},

  abstract = {Purpose: R-CHOP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) and R-CVP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) have both been used successfully in the treatment of patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma (FL). No study has compared the efficacy of the two treatment modalities and attempted to evaluate the role of anthracyclines in the management of patients with FL. We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant literature comparing the two treatment arms for FL with response being the final endpoint. Patients and Methods: Two analyses were conducted: The first analysis compared R-CHOP to R-CVP as frontline agents for the treatment of FL, and the second analysis included both untreated and relapsed patients. Results: For both studies, R-CVP was superior to R-CHOP when evaluating for complete response (CR). Odds ratios were 2.86 (95\% CI, 1.81\textendash 4.51) in the first analysis and 1.48 (95\% CI, 0.991\textendash 2.22) in the second analysis. However for overall response (CR+Partial response, PR), RCHOP was superior, with odds ratios of 5.45 (95\% CI: 2.51 \textendash{} 11.83) and 5.54 (95\% CI: 2.69 \textendash 11.40), for the first and second analyses, respectively. Conclusion: R-CHOP and R-CVP protocols achieve excellent overall response. In patients with known cardiac history, omission of anthracyclines is reasonable and R-CVP provides a competitive CR rate. In younger patients with FL where cumulative cardio-toxicity may be of importance in the long term and in whom future stem cell transplantation is an option, again R-CVP may be a more appealing option.},

However, the disease remains quite heterogeneous and a substantial number of patients have more aggressive disease with short responses to therapy and/or transformation to higher-grade lymphomas. Given the lack of a single standard approach, it is important to understand sources of heterogeneity among patients that influence initial management, surveillance strategies, and overall prognosis. Most of the validated tools, such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and FLIPI-2, apply to the frontline setting, and there is an unmet need for prognostic tools in relapsed and refractory disease states. In particular, the number of prior treatment regimens may be less important than the duration of response to the most recent regimen and the type of prior therapy received. Furthermore, despite awareness of progressive genetic and epigenetic derangements and a growing appreciation of the microenvironment's role in FL outcomes, there is no validated means of incorporating biologic data into clinical prognostic indices. This review highlights the current state of knowledge regarding risk stratification in FL.},

  abstract = {Health economic evaluation models have traditionally been built in Microsoft Excel, but more sophisticated tools are increasingly being used as model complexity and computational requirements increase. Of all the programming languages, R is most popular amongst health economists because it has a plethora of user created packages and is highly flexible. However, even with an integrated development environment such as R Studio, R lacks a simple point and click user interface and therefore requires some programming ability. This might make the switch from Microsoft Excel to R seem daunting, and it might make it difficult to directly communicate results with decisions makers and other stakeholders.,  The R package Shiny has the potential to resolve this limitation. It allows programmers to embed health economic models developed in R into interactive web browser based user interfaces. Users can specify their own assumptions about model parameters and run different scenario analyses, which, in the case of regular a Markov model, can be computed within seconds. This paper provides a tutorial on how to wrap a health economic model built in R into a Shiny application. We use a four-state Markov model developed by the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) group as a case-study to demonstrate main principles and basic functionality.,  A more extensive tutorial, all code, and data are provided in a~ GitHub repository.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: It is uncertain whether mortality rates among patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation return to the level of the mortality rates of the general population. We analyzed the characteristics of 6691 patients listed in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. All the patients were free of their original disease two years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Mortality rates in this cohort were compared with those of an age-, sex-, and nationality-matched general population. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for death more than two years after transplantation (late death). RESULTS: Among patients who were free of disease two years after transplantation, the probability of living for five more years was 89 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88 to 90 percent). Among patients who underwent transplantation for aplastic anemia, the risk of death by the sixth year after transplantation did not differ significantly from that of a normal population. Mortality remained significantly higher than normal throughout the study among patients who underwent transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia and through the ninth year among those who underwent transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia. Recurrent leukemia was the chief cause of death among patients who received a transplant for leukemia, whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease was the chief cause among those who received a transplant for aplastic anemia. Advanced, long-standing disease before transplantation and active chronic graft-versus-host disease were important risk factors for late death. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplant as treatment for acute myelogenous or lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or aplastic anemia and who are free of their original disease two years later, the disease is probably cured. However, for many years after transplantation, the mortality among these patients is higher than that in a normal population.},

  abstract = {In multiple myeloma (MM), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data is becoming increasingly important, owing to improved survival outcomes and the impact of treatment-related toxicity on HRQoL. Researchers are more frequently including HRQoL assessments in clinical trials, but analysis and reporting of this data has not been consistent. A systematic literature review assessed the effect of novel agents (thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide) on HRQoL in MM patients, and evaluated the subsequent reporting of these HRQoL results. A relatively small body of literature addresses HRQoL data in MM patients treated with novel MM therapeutic agents: 9 manuscripts and 15 conference proceedings. The literature demonstrates the complementary value of HRQoL when assessing clinical response, progression, overall survival and toxicity. However, weaknesses and inconsistencies in analysis and presentation of HRQoL data were observed, often complicating interpretation of the impact of treatment on HRQoL in MM. Further evaluation of HRQoL in MM patients treated with novel agents is required in larger cohorts, and ideally in head-to-head comparative studies. Additionally, the development of standardised MM-specific best practice guidelines in HRQoL data collection and analysis is recommended. These would ensure that future data are more useful in guiding predictive models and clinical decisions.},

We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, and potential for efficacy of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Methods This open-label study enrolled children {$<$} 18 years old with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL in a phase I dosage-escalation part and a phase II part, using 6-week treatment cycles. Primary end points were maximum-tolerated dosage (phase I) and complete remission rate within the first two cycles (phase II). Results We treated 49 patients in phase I and 44 patients in phase II. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 (phase I). Three experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome (one attributed to grade 5 cardiac failure); one had fatal respiratory failure. The maximum-tolerated dosage was 15 \textmu g/m2/d. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was linear across dosage levels and consistent among age groups. On the basis of the phase I data, the recommended blinatumomab dosage for children with relapsed/refractory ALL was 5 \textmu g/m2/d for the first 7 days, followed by 15 \textmu g/m2/d thereafter. Among the 70 patients who received the recommended dosage, 27 (39\%; 95\% CI, 27\% to 51\%) achieved complete remission within the first two cycles, 14 (52\%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. The most frequent grade {$\geq$} 3 adverse events were anemia (36\%), thrombocytopenia (21\%), and hypokalemia (17\%). Three patients (4\%) and one patient (1\%) had cytokine-release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3\%) interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures. Conclusion This trial, which to the best of our knowledge was the first such trial in pediatrics, demonstrated antileukemic activity of single-agent blinatumomab with complete minimal residual disease response in children with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL. Blinatumomab may represent an important new treatment option in this setting, requiring further investigation in curative indications.},

The disadvantages include (a) the inherent limitations of claims data, such as incomplete, inaccurate, or missing data, or the lack of specific billing codes for some conditions; and (b) the inability, in some circumstances, to adequately evaluate the appropriateness of care.

Adherence to general guidance on the reporting of claims data analyses, as outlined in this article, is important to enhance the credibility and applicability of findings.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Examining covariate balance is the prescribed method for determining the degree to which propensity score methods should be successful at reducing bias. This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (similar to a disease risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only. RESULTS: The absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD) in prognostic scores, the mean ASMD (in covariates), and the mean t-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations with bias of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification, and the prognostic score measure performed well under a variety of scenarios. CONCLUSION: Researchers should consider using prognostic score-based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in nonexperimental studies.},

  abstract = {Background The Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine has called for an ``off-the-shelf'' catalogue of nationally representative, community-based preference scores for health states, illnesses, and conditions. A previous review of cost-effectiveness analyses found that 77\% did not incorporate community-based preferences, and 33\% used arbitrary expert or author judgment. These results highlight the necessity of making a wide array of appropriate, community-based estimates more accessible to cost-effectiveness researchers. Objective To provide nationally representative EQ-5D index scores for chronic ICD-9 codes. Methods The nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was pooled (2000-2002) to create a data set of 38,678 adults. Ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression methods were used to estimate the marginal disutility of each condition, controlling for age, comorbidity, gender, race, ethnicity, income, and education. Results Most chronic conditions, age, comorbidity, income, and education were highly statistically significant predictors of EQ-5D index scores. Homoskedasticity and normality assumptions were rejected, suggesting only CLAD estimates are theoretically unbiased. The magnitude and statistical significance of coefficients varied by analytic method. OLS and Tobit coefficients were on average 60\% and 143\% greater than CLAD, respectively. The marginal disutility of 95 chronic ICD-9 codes as well as unadjusted mean, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles are reported. Conclusion This research provides nationally representative, community-based EQ-5D index scores associated with a wide variety of chronic ICD-9 codes that can be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years in cost-effectiveness analyses.},

  abstract = {The burden of cancer is growing, and the disease is becoming a major economic expenditure for all developed countries. In 2008, the worldwide cost of cancer due to premature death and disability (not including direct medical costs) was estimated to be US\$895 billion. This is not simply due to an increase in absolute numbers, but also the rate of increase of expenditure on cancer. What are the drivers and solutions to the so-called cancer-cost curve in developed countries? How are we going to afford to deliver high quality and equitable care? Here, expert opinion from health-care professionals, policy makers, and cancer survivors has been gathered to address the barriers and solutions to delivering affordable cancer care. Although many of the drivers and themes are specific to a particular field\textemdash eg, the huge development costs for cancer medicines\textemdash there is strong concordance running through each contribution. Several drivers of cost, such as over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and imaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies, have converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system, a lack of evidence-based sociopolitical debate, and a declining degree of fairness for all patients with cancer. Urgent solutions range from re-engineering of the macroeconomic basis of cancer costs (eg, value-based approaches to bend the cost curve and allow cost-saving technologies), greater education of policy makers, and an informed and transparent regulatory system. A radical shift in cancer policy is also required. Political toleration of unfairness in access to affordable cancer treatment is unacceptable. The cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence base and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost; rather, we need delivery of fair prices and real value from new technologies.},

  abstract = {Background Budget impact analyses (BIAs) are an essential part of a comprehensive economic assessment of a health care intervention and are increasingly required by reimbursement authorities as part of a listing or reimbursement submission. Objectives The objective of this report was to present updated guidance on methods for those undertaking such analyses or for those reviewing the results of such analyses. This update was needed, in part, because of developments in BIA methods as well as a growing interest, particularly in emerging markets, in matters related to affordability and population health impacts of health care interventions. Methods The Task Force was approved by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Health Sciences Policy Council and appointed by its Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of BIAs; worked in academia and industry and as advisors to governments; and came from several countries in North America and South America, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Task Force solicited comments on the drafts from a core group of external reviewers and, more broadly, from the membership of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. Results The Task Force recommends that the design of a BIA for a new health care intervention should take into account relevant features of the health care system, possible access restrictions, the anticipated uptake of the new intervention, and the use and effects of the current and new interventions. The key elements of a BIA include estimating the size of the eligible population, the current mix of treatments and the expected mix after the introduction of the new intervention, the cost of the treatment mixes, and any changes expected in condition-related costs. Where possible, the BIA calculations should be performed by using a simple cost calculator approach because of its ease of use for budget holders. In instances, however, in which the changes in eligible population size, disease severity mix, or treatment patterns cannot be credibly captured by using the cost calculator approach, a cohort or patient-level condition-specific model may be used to estimate the budget impact of the new intervention, accounting appropriately for those entering and leaving the eligible population over time. In either case, the BIA should use data that reflect values specific to a particular decision maker's population. Sensitivity analysis should be of alternative scenarios chosen from the perspective of the decision maker. The validation of the model should include at least face validity with decision makers and verification of the calculations. Data sources for the BIA should include published clinical trial estimates and comparator studies for the efficacy and safety of the current and new interventions as well as the decision maker's own population for the other parameter estimates, where possible. Other data sources include the use of published data, well-recognized local or national statistical information, and, in special circumstances, expert opinion. Reporting of the BIA should provide detailed information about the input parameter values and calculations at a level of detail that would allow another modeler to replicate the analysis. The outcomes of the BIA should be presented in the format of interest to health care decision makers. In a computer program, options should be provided for different categories of costs to be included or excluded from the analysis. Conclusions We recommend a framework for the BIA, provide guidance on the acquisition and use of data, and offer a common reporting format that will promote standardization and transparency. Adherence to these good research practice principles would not necessarily supersede jurisdiction-specific BIA guidelines but may support and enhance local recommendations or serve as a starting point for payers wishing to promulgate methodology guidelines.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Economic evaluations conducted in children have unique features compared to adults. Important developments in pediatric economic evaluation in recent years include new options for valuing health states for cost-utility analysis (CUA) and shifting child health priorities. The Pediatric Economic Database Evaluation (PEDE) project includes a comprehensive database of pediatric health economic evaluations published since 1980. The objective of this scoping review was to identify trends over time in the use of CUA and other analytic techniques, and the therapeutic areas chosen for study. Areas covered: Medical and grey literature were searched, key characteristics were extracted, frequencies were tabulated and cross-tabulations were performed. Differences between early (1980 and 1999) and late (2000 and 2014) periods were assessed using a chi-squared statistic. Of the 2,776 pediatric economic evaluations published between 1980 and 2014, substantially more were cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and CUAs than cost benefit analyses and cost minimization analyses (63.9 and 24.9\% versus 7.6 and 3.6\%, respectively). This pattern was consistent regardless of the type of intervention, disease or age group studied. A trend toward higher proportions of CUAs and CEAs was evident in the later period (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001). Other significant trends included a higher proportion of studies of preventive interventions (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001), and more studies in children aged 1 to 12~years and fewer in perinates in the later period (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001). Overall the most common disease class studied was infectious diseases (29.2\%). Expert commentary: Pediatric economic evaluation continues to grow in volume and methodologic complexity. While CUAs have increased, whether their quality has improved remains unknown. Although most studies are in infectious disease, the volume of publications may not align with emerging child health priorities such as adolescent health, injury, developmental disabilities, mental health, and the use of personalized medicine.

The patients were divided into three groups: patients who received transplants from 1977 through 1989 (group A), 1990 through 1999 (group B), and 2000 through 2004 (group C). The costs for treatment, enumerated to year 2003 costs, were calculated. An increased 1-year survival rate was found in group C, at 21\% versus 9\% and 8\% for groups A and B, respectively (P=0.02). Death by acute GVHD was increased by repeat transplantation (P{$<$}0.001), grade IV acute GVHD (P{$<$}0.001), human leukocyte antigen mismatch (P=0.009), and transplantation before 2000 (P=0.015). Transplantation after 1990 (P=0.003) and grade IV acute GVHD (P=0.03) were associated with higher treatment costs. It was found that the time the patients had GVHD did not differ among the three groups. In conclusion, the costs and survival rates associated with severe acute GVHD has increased in recent years.},

Patients treated with non-myeloablative conditioning (NMC) had reduced costs, but patients treated with reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning had similar 1-year costs. Multivariate analysis showed that increased 1-year costs were seen in post-transplant complications: rejection (relative hazard (RH) 1.24, P{$<$}0.001), acute GVHD of grades III-IV (1.31, P{$<$}0.001) and invasive fungal infection (1.15, P=0.02).

These states described the burden of both stable and progressive disease, and a variety of commonly encountered toxicities associated with first-line therapies (fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, hand/foot syndrome, hypertension and anaemia). These states were further reviewed by additional clinicians and patients to ensure their validity. One hundred members of the general public rated the states using the time trade-off (TTO) methodology to determine health state utility.Results:Stable disease had a utility value of 0.795 whilst progressive disease demonstrated a significant decline with a value of 0.355. The range of toxicities showed a variable impact in line with their toxicity grading from fatigue grade I/II (0.751) to hand/foot syndrome grade III (0.469).Conclusions:This study highlights the burden associated with a number of common toxicities encountered with current first-line mRCC treatments. Practical constraints coupled with the societal nature of the valuation exercise limited the amount of direct involvement by patients. However, these utility values should better permit the consideration of toxicity profiles in establishing the cost-effectiveness of future treatments.},

Previously untreated patients with grade 1 to 2 FL treated at Stanford University from 1960-2003 were identified. Four eras were considered: era 1, pre-anthracycline (1960-1975, n = 180); era 2, anthracycline (1976-1986, n = 426); era 3, aggressive chemotherapy/purine analogs (1987-1996, n = 471); and era 4, rituximab (1997-2003, n = 257). Clinical characteristics, patterns of care, and survival were assessed. Observed OS was compared with the expected OS calculated from Berkeley Mortality Database life tables derived from population matched by gender and age at the time of diagnosis. The median OS was 13.6 years. Age, gender, and stage did not differ across the eras. Although primary treatment varied, event-free survival after the first treatment did not differ between eras (P = .17). Median OS improved from 11 years in eras 1 and 2 to 18.4 years in era 3 and has not yet been reached for era 4 (P {$<$} .001), with no suggestion of a plateau in any era. These improvements in OS exceeded improvements in survival in the general population during the same period. Several factors, including better supportive care and effective therapies for relapsed disease, are likely responsible for this improvement.},

MethodsThis was a multicenter retrospective design. Consecutive patients with an emergency department visit in 2004 for an acute pain episode related to sickle cell disease were included. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 18 years. A structured medical record review was used to abstract data, including the following outcome variables: analgesic agent and dose, route, and time to administration of initial analgesic. Additional variables included demographics, triage level, intravenous access, and study site. Mann\textendash Whitney U test or Kruskal\textendash Wallis test and multivariate regression were used to identify differences in time to receiving an initial analgesic between groups. ResultsThere were 612 patient visits, with 159 unique patients. Median time to administration of an initial analgesic was 90 minutes (25th to 75th interquartile range, 54\textendash 159 minutes). During 87\% of visits, patients received the recommended agent (morphine or hydromorphone); 92\% received the recommended dose, and 55\% received the drug by the recommended route (intravenously or subcutaneously). Longer times to administration occurred in female patients (mean difference, 21 minutes; 95\% confidence interval = 7 to 36 minutes; p = 0.003) and patients assigned triage level 3, 4, or 5 versus 1 or 2 (mean difference, 45 minutes; 95\% confidence interval = 29 to 61 minutes; p = 0.00). Patients from study sites 1 and 2 also experienced longer delays. ConclusionsPatients with an acute painful episode related to sickle cell disease experienced significant delays to administration of an initial analgesic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has become costly and difficult to access for patients living in low-income to middle-income countries. METHODS The current retrospective study included 148 patients in Mexico with newly diagnosed MM, and was performed to compare the outcomes of patients with and without access to novel agents. The records of 77 patients admitted to a public hospital (PubC) and 71 patients cared for within private health systems (PrivC) from November 2007 to July 2016 were reviewed. RESULTS Compared with those treated in PrivC, patients receiving care at PubC were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease. A thalidomide-based regimen was the most common induction treatment used at PubC, whereas a bortezomib-based regimen was used most often in PrivC. The median follow-up was 41 months. Patients in PrivC demonstrated better response rates and survival; 65\% of patients treated in PrivC versus 41\% treated at PubC achieved a very good partial response or better (P = .005). The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 23 months and 51 months, respectively, for patients treated at PubC and 41 months and 79 months, respectively, for those treated in PrivC (P{$<$}.001). More patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation in PrivC. When adjustments were made for covariates, patients treated at PubC experienced a higher risk of death compared with patients receiving care in PrivC (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-4.3 [P = .04]). CONCLUSIONS Stage at diagnosis, induction regimen, and autologous stem cell transplantation were found to be contributors to survival disparities between patients with MM treated at PubC compared with PrivC in Mexico. These findings underscore the need to improve access to novel agents and stem cell transplantation in public health systems. Cancer 2018;124:1946-53. \textcopyright{} 2018 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Background aims Recent technical and clinical advances with cell-based therapies (CBTs) hold great promise in the treatment of patients with rare diseases and those with high unmet medical need. Currently the majority of CBTs are developed and manufactured in specialized academic facilities. Due to small scale, unique characteristics and specific supply chain, CBT manufacturing is considered costly compared to more conventional medicinal products. As a result, biomedical researchers and clinicians are increasingly faced with cost considerations in CBT development. The objective of this research was to develop a costing framework and methodology for academic and other small-scale facilities that manufacture cell-based therapies. Methods We conducted an international multi-center costing study in four facilities in Europe using eight CBTs as case studies. This study includes costs from cell or tissue procurement to release of final product for clinical use. First, via interviews with research scientists, clinicians, biomedical scientists, pharmacists and technicians, we designed a high-level costing framework. Next, we developed a more detailed uniform methodology to allocate cost items. Costs were divided into steps (tissue procurement, manufacturing and fill-finish). The steps were each subdivided into cost categories (materials, equipment, personnel and facility), and each category was broken down into facility running (fixed) costs and operational (variable) costs. The methodology was tested via the case studies and validated in developer interviews. Costs are expressed in 2018 euros (\texteuro ). Results The framework and methodology were applicable across facilities and proved sensitive to differences in product and facility characteristics. Case study cost estimates ranged between \texteuro 23~033 and \texteuro 190~799 Euros per batch, with batch yield varying between 1 and 88 doses. The cost estimations revealed hidden costs to developers and provided insights into cost drivers to help design manufacturing best practices. Conclusions This framework and methodology provide step-by-step guidance to estimate manufacturing costs specifically for cell-based therapies manufactured in academic and other small-scale enterprises. The framework and methodology can be used to inform and plan cost-conscious strategies for CBTs.},

Moreover, reliable sources of information, such as the Health Economic Evaluation Database, have ceased to publish updates. Researchers are thus left without authoritative guidance on how to conduct SR-EEs. Together with van Mastrigt et al. we seek to fill this gap.},

  abstract = {Child maltreatment is prognostically associated with long-term detrimental consequences for mental health. These consequences are reflected in higher costs due to health service utilization and productivity losses in adulthood. An above-average sense of mastery can have protective effects in the pathogenesis of mental disorders and thus potentially cushion adverse impacts of maltreatment. This should be reflected in lower costs in individuals with a history of child maltreatment and a high sense of mastery. The aims of the study were to prognostically estimate the excess costs of health service uptake and productivity losses in adults with a history of child maltreatment and to evaluate how mastery may act as an effect modifier. Data were used on 5618 individuals participating in the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS). We focussed on measures of child maltreatment (emotional neglect, physical, psychological and sexual abuse) and economic costs owing to health-care uptake and productivity losses when people with a history of abuse have grown into adulthood. We evaluated how mastery acted as an effect modifier. Estimates were adjusted for demographics and parental psychopathology. Post-stratification weights were used to account for initial non-response and dropout. Due to the non-normal distribution of the costs data, sample errors, 95~\% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping (1000 replications). Exposure to child maltreatment occurs frequently (6.9\textendash 24.8~\%) and is associated with substantial excess costs in adulthood. To illustrate, adjusted annual excess costs attributable to emotional neglect are \texteuro 1,360 (95~\% CI: 615\textendash 215) per adult. Mastery showed a significant effect on these figures: annual costs were \texteuro 1,608 in those with a low sense of mastery, but only \texteuro 474 in those with a firmer sense of mastery. Child maltreatment has profound mental health consequences and is associated with staggering long-term economic costs, rendering lack of action very costly. Our data lends credibility to the hypothesis that mastery may help to cushion the adverse consequences of child maltreatment. Further research on mastery may help to ameliorate individual burden and in addition offer some economic benefits.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the company that makes obinutuzumab (Roche Products Limited) to submit evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with chemotherapy, with or without obinutuzumab as maintenance therapy for adult patients with untreated, advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) in the UK. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical evidence was derived from two phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, open-label studies. Most evidence on obinutuzumab was based on the GALLIUM trial that compared obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by rituximab maintenance monotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL (grades 1\textendash 3a). Long-term clinical evidence was based on the PRIMA trial, studying the benefit of two years of rituximab maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with FL. The cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company relied on a partitioned survival cost-utility model, implemented in Microsoft\textregistered{} Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented in the company submission was {$<\pounds$}20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Although the ERG concluded that the economic model met the NICE reference case to a reasonable extent, some errors were identified and several assumptions made by the company were challenged. A new base-case scenario produced by the ERG suggested an ICER that was higher than the company base case, but still below \textsterling 30,000 per QALY gained. However, some ERG scenario analyses were close to or even above the threshold. This was the case in particular for assuming a treatment effect that did not extend beyond trial follow-up. These results led to an initial negative recommendation by the appraisal committee. Subsequently, the company submitted a revised base case focusing on patients at intermediate or high risk of premature mortality. Simultaneously, a further price discount for obinutuzumab was granted. In addition to the company's revised base case, the ERG suggested a restriction of the treatment effect to 5 years and implemented biosimilar uptake and cheaper prices for rituximab. All of these adjustments did not exceed \textsterling 30,000 per QALY gained and therefore the use of obinutuzumab for patients with advanced FL and a Follicular Lymphoma International Predictive Index (FLIPI) score of two or more could be recommended.},

  abstract = {Introduction In several studies, the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel demonstrated encouraging rates of remission and lasting survival benefits in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel (list price: 320 000 EUR) among these patients when compared to clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), and blinatumomab (Blina) from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. We also assessed future medical and future non-medical consumption costs. Methods A three-state partitioned survival model was used to simulate a cohort of pediatric patients (12 years of age) through different disease states until the end of life (lifetime horizon). Relevant outcomes were life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, societal costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses as well as through several scenario analyzes. Results Total discounted costs for tisagenlecleucel were 552 679 EUR from a societal perspective, which was much higher than the total discounted costs from a healthcare perspective (ie, 409 563 EUR). Total discounted societal costs for the comparator regimens ranged between 160 803 EUR for Clo-M and 267 259 EUR for Blina. Highest QALYs were estimated for tisagenlecleucel (11.26), followed by Blina (2.25), Clo-C (1.70) and Clo-M (0.74). Discounted societal ICERs of tisagenlecleucel ranged between 31 682 EUR/QALY for Blina and 37 531 EUR/QALY for Clo-C and were considered cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 80 000 EUR/QALY. None of the scenarios exceeded this threshold, and more than 98\% of the iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. Discussion At the current price and WTP threshold, tisagenlecleucel is cost-effective from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness data are needed to validate the several assumptions that were necessary for this model.},

  abstract = {Background While multiple studies have examined the cost of health care for one aspect of sickle cell disease care, few have focussed on the overall cost of comprehensive care for sickle cell disease. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with sickle cell disease treated in a comprehensive care centre from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. Health care utilisation of included patients was based upon data from two main sources. The clinical practice guideline was used to determine the expected resource use of routine comprehensive care (planned elective care), and the financial claims database was used to estimate real-world resource use associated with acute and inpatient care (additional care). Results A total of 125 children with sickle cell disease were analysed. Expenditures for these patients averaged \texteuro 5049 [standard deviation (SD) \texteuro 1634] per child per year. Total yearly costs per patient varied considerably, ranging from \texteuro 669 to \texteuro 84 010, and less than 15\% of patients were responsible for 50\% of the health care costs. The majority (37\%) of costs was associated with inpatient hospital care, which increased by age group, 27\% with diagnostics, 19\% with treatment, 11\% with outpatients' visits and 6\% with emergency care. Conclusion We have described real-world resource use and expenditures for children with sickle cell disease in a European comprehensive care centre. It seems that costs of a comprehensive approach with effective management in the outpatient setting is favourable when compared to episodic health care.},

Data sources Bibliographic searches of medical databases, specialist medical informatics databases, conference proceedings, and institutional contacts. Study selection Studies selected according to a predefined framework for categorising review papers. Data extraction Reference standards and measurements used to judge quality. Results Bibliographic searches identified 4589 publications. After primary exclusions 174 articles were classified, 52 of which met the inclusion criteria for review. Selected studies were primarily descriptive surveys. Variability in methods prevented meta-analysis of results. Forty eight publications were concerned with diagnostic data, 37 studies measured data quality, and 15 scoped EPR quality. Reliability of data was assessed with rate comparison. Measures of sensitivity were highly dependent on the element of EPR data being investigated, while the positive predictive value was consistently high, indicating good validity. Prescribing data were generally of better quality than diagnostic or lifestyle data. Conclusion The lack of standardised methods for assessment of quality of data in electronic patient records makes it difficult to compare results between studies. Studies should present data quality measures with clear numerators, denominators, and confidence intervals. Ambiguous terms such as ``accuracy'' should be avoided unless precisely defined.},

Their mean age was 69.3 {$\pm$} 7.1 (SD) years, the mean prostate volume 28.0 {$\pm$} 13.8 cc, and the mean          serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration 10.9 {$\pm$} 8.7 ng/mL. Nearly all (92.2\%) of the patients had one to four positive biopsy samples at baseline. The Gleason scores were 2 to 4 for 13.2\%          of the patients, 5 to 7 for 77.5\%, and 8 to 10 for 9.3\%. During the follow-up, random sextant biopsies and serum PSA measurements were performed. Any positive sample in biopsies performed after the last          treatment session resulted in a "HIFU failure" classification.Results: The patients received a mean of 1.4 HIFU sessions. The mean follow-up duration was 407 days (quartile 1 135 days, median          321 days, quartile 3 598 days). The negative biopsy rate observed in the T1-2 primary-care population was 87.2\%. These results were also stratified according to the usual disease-related risk classification,          and as much as a 92.1\% negative biopsy rate was observed in low-risk patients. Nadir PSA results correlated with prostate size and the clinical procedure.Conclusion: These short-term results          obtained on a large cohort confirm that HIFU is an option to be considered for the primary treatment of localized prostate cancer.},

New performance-based risk sharing could produce a more efficient market equilibrium, achieved by adjustment of the price post-launch to reflect outcomes combined with a new approach to the post-launch costs of evidence collection. For this to happen, the party best able to manage or to bear specific risks must do so. Willingness to bear risk will depend not only on ability to manage it, but on the degree of risk aversion.

The aim of this study was to assess both methodological quality and ethical quality, and also to assess the relationship between these two qualities in randomised phase III cancer trials. Method: Methodological quality (Jadad score) and ethical quality (Berdeu score) were assessed for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in 10 international journals between 1999 and 2001 (n = 231). Results: The mean Jadad score was 9.86 {$\pm$} 1.117. The methodological quality was poor in 75 RCTs (Jadad score {$<$}9). The mean Berdeu score was 0.42 {$\pm$} 0.133. The mean ethical quality score for poor methodological quality RCTs (n = 75) was 0.39 {$\pm$} 0.133; it was 0.43 {$\pm$} 0.133 for good (n = 156) methodological quality RCTs (p = 0.07). There was improvement in ethical quality according to the year of commencement of the trials (p {$<$} 0.001). There was no correlation between methodological quality and the number of participating patients (R2 = 0.003, p = 0.78), between ethical quality and the number of participating patients (R2 = 0.003, p = 0.76 ), or between ethical quality and methodological quality (R2 = 0.012, p = 0.1). ICP and REC approval were not obtained for 21 and 77 trials respectively. Conclusion: The association between methodological quality and the reporting of ethical requirements probably reflects the respect shown for patients during the whole research process. These results suggest that closer attention to the conduct of clinical research, as well as the reporting of its ethical aspects, is needed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has transformed oncology treatment, with the potential to cure certain cancers. Although shown to be effective in selected populations and studies, CAR T-cell technology requires considerable health care resources, which may lead to additional wait times to access this type of treatment in future. The objective of our study was to estimate the potential impact of increasing wait times on CAR T-cell therapy effectiveness compared with standard chemotherapy for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. METHODS A health system\textendash level discrete event simulation model was developed to project the potential impact of wait times on CAR T-cell therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Waiting queues and health states related to treatment and clinical progression were implemented. Using data from the literature, we evaluated nine scenarios of using CAR T-cell therapy with wait times ranging from 1 to 9 months. The outcome of interest was 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS Increasing the wait time of receiving CAR T-cell therapy from 1 to 9 months increased the predicted 1-year mortality rate from 36.1\% to 76.3\%. Baseline 1-year mortality was 34.0\% in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy with no wait times and 75.1\% in patients treated with chemotherapy. This resulted in an increased relative mortality rate of 6.2\% to 124.5\% over a 1- to 9-month wait time compared with no wait time. CONCLUSION We found that modest delays in CAR T-cell therapy significantly hinder its effectiveness. Because CAR T-cell therapy offers a potential cure, it is expected that the uptake rate will be substantially increased once the therapy is regularly funded by a health care system. Wait times may be prolonged if system resource availability does not match the demand. Strategies must be developed to minimize the impact of delays and reduce complications during waiting.},

The initial tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process technology was developed at an academic center and was subsequently transferred, optimized, validated, and scaled out to supply large global trials before commercialization. Tisagenlecleucel manufactured in two centralized facilities has been successfully used in global multicenter trials for B-ALL and DLBCL ({$>$}50 clinical centers in 12 countries). In this paper, we describe some of the continuous process improvements made to tisagenlecleucel manufacturing over time to meet global demand while maintaining and improving product quality. During early tisagenlecleucel clinical trials, process enhancements were made to address logistical challenges related to manufacturing for multicenter trials and to accommodate the variability observed in patient starting cellular material. These enhancements resulted in improvements in manufacturing capacity, process robustness, manufacturing success rates, and product quality, and reductions in throughput time. In summary, through continuous evaluation and improvements based on experience during global trials, a consistent and robust commercial manufacturing process for tisagenlecleucel has been developed, leading to improvements in manufacturing success when compared to the initial processes.},

Information on the efficacy and safety of Rd and VMP was based on data from multinational phase III clinical trials and a network meta-analysis. Pre-progression direct costs included the costs of Rd and VMP, treatment of adverse events (including prophylaxis) and routine care and monitoring associated with MM. Post-progression direct costs included costs of subsequent treatment(s) and routine care and monitoring for progressive disease, all obtained from published literature and estimated from a US payer perspective. Utilities were obtained from the aforementioned trials. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3\% annually.Results:Relative to VMP, use of Rd was expected to result in an additional 2.22 LYs and 1.47 QALYs (discounted). Patients initiated with Rd were expected to incur an additional \$78,977 in mean lifetime direct costs (discounted) vs those initiated with VMP. The incremental costs per QALY and per LY gained with Rd vs VMP were \$53,826 and \$35,552, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, results were found to be most sensitive to differences in survival associated with Rd vs VMP, the cost of lenalidomide and the discount rate applied to effectiveness outcomes.Conclusions:Rd was expected to result in greater LYs and QALYs compared with VMP, with similar overall costs per LY for each regimen. Results of this analysis indicated that Rd may be a cost-effective alternative to VMP as initial treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with MM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well within the levels for recent advancements in oncology.},

  abstract = {Purpose: multiple myeloma is considered an incurable hematologic cancer but a subset of patients can achieve long-term remissions and survival. The present study examines the clinical features of long-term survival as it correlates to depth of disease response. Patients \& Methods: this was a multi-institutional, international, retrospective analysis of high-dose melphalan-autologous stem cell transplant (HDM-ASCT) eligible MM patients included in clinical trials. Clinical variable and survival data were collected from 7291 MM patients from Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Spain, the Nordic Myeloma Study Group and the United States. Kaplan\textendash Meier curves were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Relative survival (RS) and statistical cure fractions (CF) were computed for all patients with available data. Results: achieving CR at 1 year was associated with superior PFS (median PFS 3.3 years vs. 2.6 years, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) as well as OS (median OS 8.5 years vs. 6.3 years, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Clinical variables at diagnosis associated with 5-year survival and 10-year survival were compared with those associated with 2-year death. In multivariate analysis, age over 65 years (OR 1.87, p\,=\,0.002), IgA Isotype (OR 1.53, p\,=\,0.004), low albumin\,{$<$}\,3.5\,g/dL (OR\,=\,1.36, p\,=\,0.023), elevated beta 2 microglobulin\,{$\geq$}\,3.5\,mg/dL (OR 1.86, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), serum creatinine levels\,{$\geq$}\,2\,mg/dL (OR 1.77, p\,=\,0.005), hemoglobin levels\,{$<$}\,10\,g/dL (OR 1.55, p\,=\,0.003), and platelet count\,{$<$}\,150k/{$\mu$}L (OR 2.26, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) appeared to be negatively associated with 10-year survival. The relative survival for the cohort was \textasciitilde 0.9, and the statistical cure fraction was 14.3\%. Conclusions: these data identify CR as an important predictor of long-term survival for HDM-ASCT eligible MM patients. They also identify clinical variables reflective of higher disease burden as poor prognostic markers for long-term survival.},

Time to patient access, speed of drug uptake, and the potential loss of life years due to a delay in access have been studied. Results. Marketing approval for the cancer drugs came on average 242 days later in Europe than in the US, and actual patient access varied extensively across Europe. The average time to market in Europe was 403 days (range 17\textendash 1187 days). The delay in patient access of ipilimumab and abiraterone may have led to a potential loss of more than 30,000 life years. Conclusion. It takes a long time for patients to get access to newly registered cancer drugs and there is great variation in access. The health outcomes can be substantially improved by faster processes.},

Direct comparisons of these novel treatments, however, are lacking. This makes it extremely difficult to evaluate the relative added value of each new treatment. Our aim was to synthesize all efficacy evidence, enabling a comparison of all current treatments for R/R MM.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review to identify all publicly available phase III randomized controlled trial evidence. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Web site www.ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, two trials presented at two international hematology congresses (ie, ASCO 2016 and European Hematology Association 2016) were added to include the most recent evidence. In total, 17 randomized controlled trials were identified, including 18 treatment options. The evidence was synthesized using a conventional network meta-analysis. To include all treatments within one network, two treatment options were combined: (1) bortezomib monotherapy and bortezomib plus dexamethasone, and (2) thalidomide monotherapy and thalidomide plus dexamethasone.ResultsThe combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone was identified as the best treatment. It was most favorable in terms of (1) hazard ratio for progression-free survival (0.13; 95\% credible interval, 0.09 to 0.19), and (2) probability of being best (99\% of the simulations). This treatment combination reduced the risk of progression or death by 87\% versus dexamethasone, 81\% versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone, and 63\% versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone.ConclusionOur network meta-analysis provides a complete overview of the relative efficacy of all available treatments for R/R MM. Until additional data from randomized studies are available, on the basis of this analysis, the combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone seems to be the best treatment option.},

  abstract = {Different research groups sometimes carry out comparable studies. Combining the data can make it possible to address additional research questions, particularly for small observational studies such as those frequently seen in palliative care research. We present a systematic approach to pool individual subject data from observational studies that addresses differences in research design, illustrating the approach with two prospective observational studies on treatment and outcomes of lower respiratory tract infection in US and Dutch nursing home residents. Benefits of pooling individual subject data include enhanced statistical power, the ability to compare outcomes and validate models across sites or settings, and opportunities to develop new measures. In our pooled dataset, we were able to evaluate treatments and end-of-life decisions for comparable patients across settings, which suggested opportunities to improve care. In addition, greater variation in participants and treatments in the combined dataset allowed for subgroup analyses and interaction hypotheses, but required more complex analytic methods. Pitfalls included the large amount of time required for equating study procedures and variables and the need for additional funding.},

Data from all 54,015 patients newly diagnosed in the Netherlands with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma during 1989\textendash 2008, aged 15\textendash 89 years (Netherlands Cancer Registry), were used. Five-year conditional relative survival was computed for every additional year of survival up to 16 years after diagnosis, according to entity, grade, gender, age, and Ann Arbor stage. The prognosis for survivors of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma improved slightly with each additional year survived up to 91\%. For patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma conditional relative survival improved strongly during the first year after diagnosis (from 48\% to 68\%) and gradually thereafter to 93\% after 16 years. There were differences between morphological entities. Initial differences in conditional relative survival at diagnosis between groups with different disease stages became smaller with increasing number of years survived. Age remained a prognostic indicator, also after prolonged follow-up. These results help caregivers to plan optimal surveillance and inform patients about their actual prognosis during follow-up. Long-lasting excess mortality among patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma indicates the need for additional care long after their diagnosis.},

Those in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) were randomized to maintenance with R (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years) or observation.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In 2006, we published the results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase III trial EORTC 20981 on the role of rituximab in remission induction and maintenance treatment of relapsed/resistant follicular lymphoma (FL). At that time, the median follow-up for the maintenance phase was 33 months. Now, we report the long-term outcome of maintenance treatment, with a median follow-up of 6 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 465 patients were randomly assigned to induction with either six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Those in complete remission or partial remission after induction (n = 334) were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months) or observation. RESULTS: Rituximab maintenance significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation (median, 3.7 years v 1.3 years; P {$<$} .001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55), both after CHOP induction (P {$<$} .001; HR, 0.37) and R-CHOP (P = .003; HR, 0.69). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74\% in the rituximab maintenance arm, and it was 64\% in the observation arm (P = .07). After progression, a rituximab-containing salvage therapy was given to 59\% of patients treated with CHOP followed by observation, compared with 26\% after R-CHOP followed by rituximab maintenance. Rituximab maintenance was associated with a significant increase in grades 3 to 4 infections: 9.7\% v 2.4\% (P = .01). CONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up, we confirm the superior PFS with rituximab maintenance in relapsed/resistant FL. The improvement of OS did not reach statistical significance, possibly because of the unbalanced use of rituximab in post-protocol salvage treatment.},

This article explains how this shift of authority could happen and explores whether it will lead to a European healthcare union. It argues that federalism offers the most fruitful way to do so because of its sensitivity to the EU's institutional settings and to the territorial dimension of politics. The division of competences and national diversity of healthcare systems have been major obstacles for the formation of a healthcare union. However, the EU obtained a role in healthcare through the impact of non-healthcare legislation, voluntary co-operation, court rulings, governments' joint-decision traps and fiscal stress of member states. The emerging European healthcare union is a system of co-operative federalism without much cost-sharing. The healthcare union's robustness is limited, also because it does not generate much loyalty towards the EU.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2{$\cdot$}4 billion and 1{$\cdot$}6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537{$\cdot$}6 million in 1990 to 764{$\cdot$}8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114{$\cdot$}87 per 1000 people to 110{$\cdot$}31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21{$\cdot$}1\% in 1990 to 31{$\cdot$}2\% in 2013.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There are limited treatment options and substantial unmet needs for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) in Japan. In 2019, tisagenlecleucel, a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, was approved for r/r DLBCL in Japan. The efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel were demonstrated in the pivotal phase II single-arm JULIET trial. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy versus current standard of care (salvage chemotherapy treatment strategy) for the treatment of patients with r/r DLBCL in Japan. A three-state partitioned survival model was constructed from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective, with the following three health states: progression-free survival, progressive/relapsed disease, and death. Because the tisagenlecleucel arm included patients who did or did not receive the infusion, a decision-tree structure was used to partition patients based on their infusion status. Treatment efficacy and costs were based on tisagenlecleucel-infused patients for those who received the infusion; for non-infused patients, they were based on standard salvage chemotherapy. The efficacy inputs for tisagenlecleucel-infused patients and salvage chemotherapy were based on observed data in the JULIET trial and the international SCHOLAR-1 meta-analysis, respectively, before year 3. Afterward, all patients were assumed to have no further progression and to incur the mortality risk of long-term DLBCL survivors. The base case analysis explored a lifetime horizon (44 years), with costs and effectiveness discounted 2.0\% annually, and it used a monthly model cycle. Direct costs were considered in the base case, composed of pretreatment costs, treatment costs, adverse events management costs, follow-up costs before progression, subsequent SCT costs, post-progression costs, and terminal care costs. Total incremental costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared for tisagenlecleucel versus salvage chemotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the costs per QALY gained, and a threshold of \textyen 7.5 million was used to assess whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The total LYs (discounted) for tisagenlecleucel and salvage chemotherapy were 7.24 and 4.35 years, respectively; the corresponding QALYs were 5.42 and 2.57 years, respectively. The discounted incremental LYs and QALYs comparing tisagenlecleucel to salvage chemotherapy were estimated as 2.89 and 2.85 years, respectively. Over a lifetime horizon, the model estimated that tisagenlecleucel had a total incremental cost of \textyen 15,590,335 (discounted) versus salvage chemotherapy. Tisagenlecleucel was associated with an ICER of \textyen 5,476,496 per QALY gained compared to salvage chemotherapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the base-case findings. Tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective treatment strategy for r/r DLBCL compared to salvage chemotherapy treatment strategy from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective.},

  abstract = {Background The authors consider whether differences in stage at diagnosis could explain the variation in lung cancer survival between six developed countries in 2004\textendash 2007. Methods Routinely collected population-based data were obtained on all adults (15\textendash 99 years) diagnosed with lung cancer in 2004\textendash 2007 and registered in regional and national cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK. Stage data for 57 352 patients were consolidated from various classification systems. Flexible parametric hazard models on the log cumulative scale were used to estimate net survival at 1 year and the excess hazard up to 18 months after diagnosis. Results Age-standardised 1-year net survival from non-small cell lung cancer ranged from 30\% (UK) to 46\% (Sweden). Patients in the UK and Denmark had lower survival than elsewhere, partly because of a more adverse stage distribution. However, there were also wide international differences in stage-specific survival. Net survival from TNM stage I non-small cell lung cancer was 16\% lower in the UK than in Sweden, and for TNM stage IV disease survival was 10\% lower. Similar patterns were found for small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There are comparability issues when using population-based data but, even given these constraints, this study shows that, while differences in stage at diagnosis explain some of the international variation in overall lung cancer survival, wide disparities in stage-specific survival exist, suggesting that other factors are also important such as differences in treatment. Stage should be included in international cancer survival studies and the comparability of population-based data should be improved.},

  abstract = {As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, Novartis submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel for treating paediatric and young adult patients (under the age of 25~years) with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This article presents a summary of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) independent review of the evidence submission, the committee's deliberations, and the subsequent development of NICE guidance for the use of tisagenlecleucel on the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) product, the first of this emerging therapeutic class to be considered by NICE in this indication. The company's evidence submission was based upon three single-arm, phase II studies: ELIANA, ENSIGN, and B2101J. These trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of tisagenlecleucel, with significant extensions in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to historical control datasets on blinatumomab and salvage chemotherapy. Adverse events were common; 77\% of patients suffered from cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 56\% of whom required intensive care unit-level care. The ERG did not consider clofarabine monotherapy an appropriate proxy for salvage chemotherapy. The company presented a hybrid cost-effectiveness model, combining a decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model structure. The majority of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were generated through additional life-years in the extrapolated `long-term survival' phase of the model, where patients were assumed to be `cured'. The ERG considered the results to be subject to substantial uncertainty, due in part to immature trial data, unresolved long-term treatment effects, and a lack of appropriate comparator data. The ERG implemented a number of changes to the company's model in an alternative base case, producing deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of \textsterling 45,397 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and \textsterling 27,732 versus blinatumomab. The probabilistic model produced ICERs of \textsterling 48,265 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and \textsterling 29,501 versus blinatumomab. The committee considered the ERG's analysis to be most closely aligned with their preferred assumptions, and did not consider tisagenlecleucel to meet both of the end-of-life (EoL) criteria. In recognition of the innovative nature of tisagenlecleucel, and the present immaturity of ongoing clinical trials, the committee considered further data collection would be valuable in resolving uncertainties around OS, the technology's novel mechanism of action, and the management of CRS and B-cell aplasia. The committee therefore recommended tisagenlecleucel for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until the conclusion of the ELIANA study (June 2023). This appraisal highlighted the difficulty of interpreting EoL criteria in the context of curative therapies and the valuation of cure versus extension of life. Further clarification of NICE's position in these situations may be necessary to ensure consistency and equity in their decision-making.},

Abnormal sickle-shaped erythrocytes disrupt blood flow in small vessels, and this vaso-occlusion leads to distal tissue ischaemia and inflammation, with symptoms defining the acute painful sickle-cell crisis. Repeated sickling and ongoing haemolytic anaemia, even when subclinical, lead to parenchymal injury and chronic organ damage, causing substantial morbidity and early mortality. Currently available treatments are limited to transfusions and hydroxycarbamide, although stem cell transplantation might be a potentially curative therapy. Several new therapeutic options are in development, including gene therapy and gene editing. Recent advances include systematic universal screening for stroke risk, improved management of iron overload using oral chelators and non-invasive MRI measurements, and point-of-care diagnostic devices. Controversies include the role of haemolysis in sickle cell disease pathophysiology, optimal management of pregnancy, and strategies to prevent cerebrovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard treatment for untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is rituximab plus chemotherapy. The incidence of histological transformation of follicular lymphoma has been reported only in heterogeneously treated populations and rarely with long-term follow-up. Additionally, the incidence of secondary malignancies after treatment, without high-dose therapy for follicular lymphoma, is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to assess progression-free survival, overall survival, incidence of secondary malignancies, and incidence of histological transformation in a 10-year follow-up analysis of the JCOG0203 trial. Methods: In the phase 2\textendash 3 randomised JCOG0203 trial, previously untreated patients with stage III or IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1\textendash 3 follicular lymphoma, from 44 hospital centres in Japan, were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a minimisation method to receive six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m 2 ], given on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m 2 ], doxorubicin [50 mg/m 2 ], vincristine [1{$\cdot$}4 mg/m 2 , capped at 2{$\cdot$}0 mg] given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone [100 mg once daily on days 3\textendash 7]) every 3 weeks (R-CHOP-21) or every 2 weeks (enabled by mandatory granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration once daily for 6 days, starting on day 8; R-CHOP-14) without rituximab maintenance. Age, bulky disease (nodal or extranodal mass {$\geq$}10 cm in diameter on CT), and institution were used as adjustment factors. Investigators enrolled participants, and assignment to trial groups was done with a computer-assisted randomisation allocation sequence that took place centrally at the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center, without the intervention of investigators. Interventions were not masked for patients or investigators. Data were collected 10 years after enrolment of the last patient. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 part of the study was progression-free survival, and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response. Accrual was 4{$\cdot$}5 years, and follow-up was 3 years after registration was closed. Data were updated on the cutoff date of Feb 28, 2017. Intention-to-treat analyses (ie, progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of secondary malignancies) were predefined, to be done at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. An additional analysis of the incidence of histological transformation was defined 15 years after the protocol, on May 8, 2017, in a supplementary analysis plan, and assessed at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. Follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147121. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2002, and Feb 28, 2007, 300 patients were enrolled, and 149 (50\%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-21 group and 151 (50\%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-14 group. After eligibility was assessed, one patient was excluded from the R-CHOP-21 group. 10-year progression-free survival was not different between groups (R-CHOP-21 33\%, 95\% CI 25\textendash 41; R-CHOP-14 39\%, 31\textendash 47; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}89, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}67\textendash 1{$\cdot$}17). In 248 patients with grade 1\textendash 3a follicular lymphoma, progression-free survival was 39\% (33\textendash 45) at 8 years and 36\% (30\textendash 42) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of histological transformation was 3{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}5\textendash 6{$\cdot$}0) at 5 years, 8{$\cdot$}5\% (5{$\cdot$}4\textendash 12{$\cdot$}4) at 8 years, and 9{$\cdot$}3\% (6{$\cdot$}1\textendash 13{$\cdot$}4) at 10 years after enrolment. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies was 8{$\cdot$}1\% (5{$\cdot$}1\textendash 12{$\cdot$}0) and the cumulative incidence of haematological secondary malignancies was 2{$\cdot$}9\% (1{$\cdot$}3\textendash 5{$\cdot$}5). Interpretation: R-CHOP is a viable option for first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular lymphoma. Clinicians choosing a first-line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma should be cautious of secondary malignancies caused by immunochemotherapy and severe complications of infectious diseases in the long-term follow-up\textemdash both of which could lead to death.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is useful for reviewers of economic evaluations to assess quality in a manner that is consistent and comprehensive. Checklists can allow this, but there are concerns about their reliability and how they are used in practice. We aimed to describe how checklists have been used in systematic reviews of health economic evaluations. METHODS: Meta-review with snowball sampling. We compiled a list of checklists for health economic evaluations and searched for the checklists' use in systematic reviews from January 2010 to February 2018. We extracted data regarding checklists used, stated checklist function, subject area, number of reviewers, and issues expressed about checklists. RESULTS: We found 346 systematic reviews since 2010 that used checklists to assess economic evaluations. The most common checklist in use was developed in 1996 by Drummond and Jefferson, and the most common stated use of a checklist was quality assessment. Checklists and their use varied within subject areas; 223 reviews had more than one reviewer who used the checklist. CONCLUSIONS: Use of checklists is inconsistent. Eighteen individual checklists have been used since 2010, many of which have been used in ways different from those originally intended, often without justification. Different systematic reviews in the same subject areas would benefit from using one checklist exclusively, using checklists as intended, and having 2 reviewers complete the checklist. This would increase the likelihood that results are transparent and comparable over time.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an increasingly important endpoint in prostate cancer care. However, pivotal issues that are not fully assessed in existing HRQOL instruments include irritative urinary symptoms, hormonal symptoms, and multi-item scores quantifying bother between urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal domains. We sought to develop a novel instrument to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer-related HRQOL. METHODS: Instrument development was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding the 20-item University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) to the 50-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC). Summary and subscale scores were derived by content and factor analyses. Reliability and validity were assessed by test-retest correlation, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, interscale correlation, and EPIC correlation with other validated instruments. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each r {$>$}/=0.80 and Cronbach's alpha {$>$}/=0.82) and for most domain-specific subscales. Correlations between function and bother subscales within domains were high (r {$>$}0.60). Correlations between different primary domains were consistently lower, indicating that these domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), indicating rationale for their concurrent use. Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains relevant to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) and the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap. CONCLUSIONS: EPIC is a robust prostate cancer HRQOL instrument that complements prior instruments by measuring a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms, thereby providing a unique tool for comprehensive assessment of HRQOL issues important in contemporary prostate cancer management.},

Despite its undeniable therapeutic value, we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of action responsible for rituximab's anti-tumor effects. Direct signaling, complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC), and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) all appear to play a role in rituximab efficacy. In vitro, animal model and clinical data addressing each of these mechanisms of action are reviewed, as are data speaking to the complexity of interactions between these mechanisms. Taken together, these data suggest different mechanisms are likely important in different scenarios. Study of the complex mechanisms of action that contribute to the clinical efficacy of rituximab have led to novel clinical trials including novel combinations, schedules, and generation of additional antibodies designed to have even greater effect. Such studies need to be accompanied by rigorous correlative analysis if we are to understand the importance of various mechanisms of action of rituximab and use that information to improve on what is already an indispensable component of therapy.},

  abstract = {Search filters are increasingly used to search medical databases to identify specific topics or study designs. In particular, search filters have been designed to help health-care professionals identify systematic reviews of the effectiveness of health interventions. Identifying systematic reviews in databases such as MEDLINE is problematic and research has previously been undertaken into methods to design search filters that retrieve systematic reviews effectively. The aim of this study was to improve previously developed methods to derive a more objective search strategy to identify systematic reviews in MEDLINE. A `quasi-gold standard' collection of known systematic reviews was identified. A frequency analysis of words within a subset of the `quasi-gold standard' was undertaken followed by a statistical analysis of the most frequently occurring words. This analysis determined which terms would best distinguish between systematic reviews, non-systematic reviews and non-reviews. The performance of the best models was tested on the remaining subset of `quasi-gold standard' records and then using the OVID interface to MEDLINE. The best model had a sensitivity of 73.4\% for systematic reviews in the test set and 84.2\% when used with the validation set. The best model had a specificity of 98.3\% in the test set and 93\% in the validation set. When tested on the same `quasi-gold standard' using OVID MED-LINE the model showed 100\% sensitivity and 4.4\% precision. The number of times a term occurs in a record adds discriminatory power to the search strategy. Apparently highly relevant terms chosen subjectively do not perform as well as those derived by a statistical approach. Some search terms may not immediately seem useful in identifying systematic reviews, but when used in combination with other terms they prove to be highly discriminating. The best performing filters were tested on the OVID interface, but without frequency and term weightings. Their performance was also compared to previously published filters. One of the strategies was found to perform better with respect to sensitivity than previously published filters, although with lower precision.},

  abstract = {AbstractObjective To develop ROBIS, a new tool for assessing the risk of bias in systematic reviews (rather than in primary studies). Study Design and Setting We used four-stage approach to develop ROBIS: define the scope, review the evidence base, hold a face-to-face meeting, and refine the tool through piloting. Results ROBIS is currently aimed at four broad categories of reviews mainly within health care settings: interventions, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. The target audience of ROBIS is primarily guideline developers, authors of overviews of systematic reviews (``reviews of reviews''), and review authors who might want to assess or avoid risk of bias in their reviews. The tool is completed in three phases: (1) assess relevance (optional), (2) identify concerns with the review process, and (3) judge risk of bias. Phase 2 covers four domains through which bias may be introduced into a systematic review: study eligibility criteria; identification and selection of studies; data collection and study appraisal; and synthesis and findings. Phase 3 assesses the overall risk of bias in the interpretation of review findings and whether this considered limitations identified in any of the phase 2 domains. Signaling questions are included to help judge concerns with the review process (phase 2) and the overall risk of bias in the review (phase 3); these questions flag aspects of review design related to the potential for bias and aim to help assessors judge risk of bias in the review process, results, and conclusions. Conclusions ROBIS is the first rigorously developed tool designed specifically to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {Importance Among children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival is 10\% to 20\%. Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is expensive, with a current list price of \$475000 per one-time administration. Objective To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. Interventions The primary intervention of interest was tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent clofarabine. Main Outcomes and Measures Model outcomes included life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and QALY gained. Results Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of \$667000, with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately \$337000, with discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately \$42000 per life-year gained and approximately \$46000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from \$37000 to \$78000 per QALY gained.

This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards to ensure high-value care.},

  abstract = {Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option for B-cell lymphoma. It is expected to have long-term survival benefits; however, long-term survival data are limited.To estimate the long-term survival and cost-effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.Economic evaluation study using a survival analysis that digitized and extrapolated survival curves published in the ZUMA-1 trial (Safety and Efficacy of KTE-C19 in Adults With Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), which enrolled patients between November 2015 and September 2016 and had a maximum follow-up of 24 months. Five different survival models (standard parametric, flexible parametric, 2 mixture cure models, and a flexible parametric mixture model) were used to extrapolate the survival curves to a lifetime horizon from January through June 2018. A cost-effectiveness analysis, from both a trial-based and lifetime horizon, was also conducted to inform the value of this novel therapy. The model was based on data from 111 patients with B-cell lymphoma who were enrolled in the ZUMA-1 trial.One-time administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with chemotherapy.Undiscounted and discounted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental costs per LY and QALY gained.The modeled cohort of 111 patients started at 58 years of age. At the end of the trial, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in 0.48 more LYs and 0.34 more QALYs than chemotherapy, producing a cost-effectiveness estimate of \$896 600 per QALY for public payers and \$1 615 000 per QALY for commercial payers. Extrapolated long-term survival for patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel ranged from 2.83 to 9.19 discounted LYs and from 2.07 to 7.62 discounted QALYs. Incrementally, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was associated with 1.89 to 5.82 discounted LYs and 1.52 to 4.90 discounted QALYs vs chemotherapy. With the use of these incremental estimates of survival, cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from \$82 400 to \$230 900 per QALY gained for public payers and from \$100 400 to \$289 000 per QALY gained for commercial payers.Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel appears to be associated with incremental gains in survival over chemotherapy. The range in projected long-term survival was wide and reflected uncertainty owing to limited follow-up data. Cost-effectiveness is associated with long-term survival, with further evidence needed to reduce uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The increasing number of treatment options and the high costs associated with epilepsy have fostered the development of economic evaluations in epilepsy. It is important to examine the availability and quality of these economic evaluations and to identify potential research gaps. As well as looking at both pharmacologic (antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation) therapies, this review examines the methodologic quality of the full economic evaluations included. Literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Econlit, Web of Science, and CEA Registry. In addition, Cochrane Reviews, Cochrane DARE and Cochrane Health Technology Assessment Databases were used. To identify relevant studies, predefined clinical search strategies were combined with a search filter designed to identify health economic studies. Specific search strategies were devised for the following topics: (1) AEDs, (2) patients with cognitive deficits, (3) elderly patients, (4) epilepsy surgery, (5) ketogenic diet, (6) vagus nerve stimulation, and (7) treatment of (non)convulsive status epilepticus. A total of 40 publications were included in this review, 29 (73\%) of which were articles about pharmacologic interventions. Mean quality score of all articles on the Consensus Health Economic Criteria (CHEC)-extended was 81.8\%, the lowest quality score being 21.05\%, whereas five studies had a score of 100\%. Looking at the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS), the average quality score was 77.0\%, the lowest being 22.7\%, and four studies rated as 100\%. There was a substantial difference in methodology in all included articles, which hampered the attempt to combine information meaningfully. Overall, the methodologic quality was acceptable; however, some studies performed significantly worse than others. The heterogeneity between the studies stresses the need to define a reference case (e.g., how should an economic evaluation within epilepsy be performed) and to derive consensus on what constitutes "standard optimal care."},

PsyMod is a state-transition cohort simulation model and considers six health states, namely ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), FEP, post-FEP, no-UHR, recovery/remission, and death. Results are expressed as total healthcare costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and budget impact.Results: PsyMod was used to extrapolate budget impact and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for preventing FEP for individuals at UHR of psychosis (CBTuhr) compared to care as usual. CBTuhr resulted in a per-patient increase of 0.06 QALYs and a per patient cost reduction of \texteuro 654 (dominant ICER) with a reduction in 5-year healthcare costs of \texteuro 1,002,166.Conclusions: PsyMod can be used to examine cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interventions targeting prevention and treatment of FEP and is freely available for academic purposes upon request by the authors.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence from health services research (HSR) is currently thinly spread through many journals, making it difficult for health services researchers, managers and policy-makers to find research on clinical practice guidelines and the appropriateness, process, outcomes, cost and economics of health care services. We undertook to develop and test search terms to retrieve from the MEDLINE database HSR articles meeting minimum quality standards.Methods: The retrieval performance of 7445 methodologic search terms and phrases in MEDLINE (the test) were compared with a hand search of the literature (the gold standard) for each issue of 68 journal titles for the year 2000 (a total of 25 936 articles). We determined sensitivity, specificity and precision (the positive predictive value) of the MEDLINE search strategies.Results: A majority of the articles that were classified as outcome assessment, but fewer than half of those in the other categories, were considered methodologically acceptable (no methodologic criteria were applied for cost studies). Combining individual search terms to maximize sensitivity, while keeping specificity at 50\% or more, led to sensitivities in the range of 88.1\% to 100\% for several categories (specificities ranged from 52.9\% to 97.4\%). When terms were combined to maximize specificity while keeping sensitivity at 50\% or more, specificities of 88.8\% to 99.8\% were achieved. When terms were combined to maximize sensitivity and specificity while minimizing the differences between the 2 measurements, most strategies for HSR categories achieved sensitivity and specificity of at least 80\%.Interpretation: Sensitive and specific search strategies were validated for retrieval of HSR literature from MEDLINE. These strategies have been made available for public use by the US National Library of Medicine at www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/hedges/search.html.},

The approval process of drugs is well established and access delays can be caused directly or indirectly by national or regional decision-making processes on reimbursement. The two key aspects for those involved in reimbursement decisions are first the level of evidence required to decide and second pricing, which can be challenging for some innovative oncology compounds, especially in Eastern and South-Eastern European countries. Other important factors include: available healthcare budget; the structure and sophistication of healthcare authorities and health technology assessment processes; societal context and political will. From the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry, better alignment between stakeholders in the process and adaptive pathway initiatives is desirable. Key aspects for patients are improved access to clinical trials, preapproval availability and reports on real-world evidence. Restricted access limits oncologists' daily work in Eastern and South-Eastern EU countries. The roundtable discussion suggested considering the sequencing of regulatory approval and reimbursement decisions together with more flexible contracting as a possible way forward. The panel concluded that early and regular dialogue between all stakeholders including regulators, payers, patient stakeholders and industry is required to improve the situation.},

  abstract = {Modeling of clinical-effectiveness in a cost-effectiveness analysis typically involves some form of partitioned survival or Markov decision-analytic modeling. The health states progression-free, progression and death and the transitions between them are frequently of interest. With partitioned survival, progression is not modeled directly as a state; instead, time in that state is derived from the difference in area between the overall survival and the progression-free survival curves. With Markov decision-analytic modeling, a priori assumptions are often made with regard to the transitions rather than using the individual patient data directly to model them. This article compares a multi-state modeling survival regression approach to these two common methods. As a case study, we use a trial comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We calculated mean Life Years and QALYs that involved extrapolation of survival outcomes in the trial. We adapted an existing multi-state modeling approach to incorporate parametric distributions for transition hazards, to allow extrapolation. The comparison showed that, due to the different assumptions used in the different approaches, a discrepancy in results was evident. The partitioned survival and Markov decision-analytic modeling deemed the treatment cost-effective with ICERs of just over \textsterling 16,000 and \textsterling 13,000, respectively. However, the results with the multi-state modeling were less conclusive, with an ICER of just over \textsterling 29,000. This work has illustrated that it is imperative to check whether assumptions are realistic, as different model choices can influence clinical and cost-effectiveness results.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether adherence with one antiretroviral medication reliably predicts adherence with other antiretroviral medications. DESIGN Cross-sectional repeated-measurement analysis. SETTING Cohort study enrolling patients from Massachusetts and Rhode Island. PATIENTS Total of 454 patients using antiretroviral medications for HIV infection. METHODS For each antiretroviral medication, we asked patients to report how many days in the last week they had 1) missed a dose of the medication and 2) been off schedule with a dose of the medication. The reliability coefficient was used to compare between-pfile:///C:/Users/58509wth/Downloads/00126334-200111010-00009.pdferson variance in adherence rates with total variance, which is the sum of between-person and within-person variance. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 42 years; 28\% were women and 37\% were nonwhite. Sixty-six percent of patients were on three or more antiretroviral medications. Perfect adherence was reported by 42\% of patients, and patients reported missing a dose on a mean of 1.5 days per week for each antiretroviral medication currently being taken. The reliability coefficient for days in the last week that the medication was missed was 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.87), and for days off-schedule in the last week, it was 0.88 (CI: 0.86-0.89). CONCLUSIONS Most of the variability in antiretroviral adherence in this study was accounted for by between-patient differences in overall adherence rather than by within-patient differences in adherence patterns across medications. These data support the theory that when patients skip or are off schedule with doses, they skip or are off schedule with all the antiretroviral medications taken at that time. In the course of exploring patients' adherence issues, clinicians may find it useful to inquire about problematic dosing times. Researchers assessing adherence may not need to separately monitor adherence with each antiretroviral medication in a regimen.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Celgene) of lenalidomide (Revlimid\textregistered ), as part of the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, to submit evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab (MabThera\textregistered ), together referred to as R2, for the treatment of adults with treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review on the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. The CS included one relevant study, for the comparison of R2 versus rituximab monotherapy (R-mono): the AUGMENT trial. In addition, the company performed an unanchored indirect comparison of R2 versus rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) and rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), using data for R2 from the AUGMENT trial and pooled data for R-CHOP/R-CVP from the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) database. During the STA process, the company provided an addendum containing evidence on only the FL population, in line with the marketing authorisation obtained at that time, which did not include MZL. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented by the company were \textsterling 27,768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for R2 versus R-CHOP, \textsterling 41,602 per QALY gained for R2 versus R-CVP, and \textsterling 23,412 per QALY gained for R2 versus R-mono. The ERG's concerns included the validity of the unanchored comparison, the unavailability of a state transition model to verify the outcomes of the partitioned survival model, substantial uncertainty in survival curves, and potential over-estimation of utility values. The revised ERG base case resulted in ICERs ranging from \textsterling 16,874 to \textsterling 44,888 per QALY gained for R2 versus R-CHOP, from \textsterling 23,135 to \textsterling 59,810 per QALY gained for R2 versus R-CVP, and from \textsterling 18,779 to \textsterling 27,156 per QALY gained for R2 versus R-mono. Substantial uncertainty remained around these ranges. NICE recommended R2 within its marketing authorisation, as an option for previously treated FL (grade 1\textendash 3A) in adults, contingent on the company providing lenalidomide according to the commercial arrangement.},

After ex vivo production and re-infusion, they are able to proliferate in the host and to recognize and kill tumor cells. Together with checkpoint inhibition, this new therapy is already being celebrated as a~major medical breakthrough in recent years, due to the substantial benefit observed in clinical trials with patients with chemotherapy-refractory B-cell malignancies. These results have led to the recent approval of two CAR T-cell products by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. The list of targetable antigens and possible indications is continuously being expanded, as are the modifications to the CAR structure and the final cell products currently under investigation. In some patients, CAR T-cell therapy may lead to substantial toxicity including the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In summary, CAR T-cell therapy has already provided clinical benefit to patients with B-cell malignancies unresponsive to conventional treatment. Yet, the therapy is still in an early stage of development, and the many opportunities for improvement in its various aspects as well as its future role in relation to conventional therapy will set the pace in the field of hematology for the next years or even decades.},

  abstract = {Cost-utility models are increasingly used in many countries to establish whether the cost of a new intervention can be justified in terms of health benefits. Health-state utility (HSU) estimates (the preference for a given state of health on a cardinal scale where 0 represents dead and 1 represents full health) are typically among the most important and uncertain data inputs in cost-utility models. Clinical trials represent an important opportunity for the collection of health-utility data. However, trials designed primarily to evaluate efficacy and safety often present challenges to the optimal collection of HSU estimates for economic models. Careful planning is needed to determine which of the HSU estimates may be measured in planned trials; to establish the optimal methodology; and to plan any additional studies needed. This report aimed to provide a framework for researchers to plan the collection of health-utility data in clinical studies to provide high-quality HSU estimates for economic modeling. Recommendations are made for early planning of health-utility data collection within a research and development program; design of health-utility data collection during protocol development for a planned clinical trial; design of prospective and cross-sectional observational studies and alternative study types; and statistical analyses and reporting.},

As the number of published EEs grows, so does the number of systematic reviews (SRs) of EEs. Although search methodology makes an important contribution to SR quality, search methods in reviews of EEs have not been evaluated in detail. We investigated the resources used to identify studies in recent, published SRs of EEs, and assessed whether the resources reflected recommendations. Methods: We searched MEDLINE for SRs of EEs published since January 2013 and extracted the following from eligible reviews: databases searched, health technology assessment (HTA) sources searched, supplementary search techniques used. Results were compared against the minimum search resources recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (MEDLINE, Embase, NHS EED, EconLit) for economic evidence for single technology appraisals, and resource types suggested in the summary of current best evidence from SuRe Info (economic databases, general databases, HTA databases, HTA agency Web pages, gray literature). Results: Sixty-five SRs met the inclusion criteria; data were extracted from forty-two. Five reviews (12 percent) met or exceeded the NICE recommended resources. Nine reviews (21 percent) searched at least four of the five types of resource recommended by SuRe Info. Five reviews (12 percent) searched all five. Twenty-three reviews (55 percent) did not meet the NICE recommendations or four of five of the SuRe Info recommended resource types. Search reporting was frequently unclear or incorrect. Conclusions: Searches conducted for the majority of recently published SRs of EEs do not meet two published approaches.},

This study compared top-down and bottom-up approaches to collecting unit cost data across centres in the context of examining the cost-effectiveness of dialysis therapy across Europe. The study tested whether health care technologies in different countries can be costed using consistent and transparent methods to increase the comparability of results. There was more agreement across the approaches for peritoneal dialysis than for than haemodialysis, with differences, respectively of Euro 91-1,687 vs. 333-7,314 per patient per year. Haemodialysis results showed greatest differences where dialysis units were integrated as part of larger hospitals. Deciding which approach to adopt depends largely on the technology. However, bottom-up costing should be considered for technologies with a large component of staff input or overheads, significant sharing of staff or facilities between technologies or patient groups and health care costing systems which do not routinely allocate costs to the intervention level. In these circumstances this costing approach could increase consistency and transparency and hence comparability of cost results.},

Limited data exist on healthcare resource use and costs of aGVHD during HSCT engraftment admission. This study estimated LOS, charges, and costs of aGVHD during HSCT engraftment admission in the US. Methods: Inpatient discharges between 2009-2013 using the Nationwide In-patient Sample (NIS) database were analyzed. NIS is a representative (20\% stratified) sample of all discharges from US community hospitals included in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Discharges for allogeneic HSCT engraftment admissions with aGVHD (ICD-9 279.51) were compared with those without GVHD. Costs were calculated from hospital charges using a standard HCUP Charge-to-Cost Ratio. LOS, charges, and costs were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Correlation between LOS and charges or costs was calculated using Pearsons coefficient. Results: 729 discharges with aGVHD and 5958 discharges without GVHD were analyzed. Demographic characteristics were similar for both groups except age: female (40\% vs 42\%), Caucasian (67\% vs 68\%), private insurance (60\% vs 63\%); mean age was 39 and 45 years for patients with and without aGVHD respectively (p {$<$} 0.001). In-hospital mortality rate was 16\% for patients with aGVHD vs 5\% without GVHD (p {$<$} 0.001). Despite younger age of the aGVHD group, mean unadjusted LOS was significantly longer, and mean unadjusted charges and costs were significantly higher with aGVHD vs without GVHD (54.2 days vs 29.8 days, \$690,244 vs \$366,213, \$218,425 vs \$122,387, respectively). Charges and costs were directly proportional to LOS (r = 0.711, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, occurrence of aGVHD during HSCT engraftment admission resulted in almost doubling of LOS, charges, and costs. Mitigating aGVHD may reduce LOS and subsequent inpatient resource use for HSCT. aGVHDNo GVHDDifference*LOS, days, mean (SE)54.2 (1.5)29.8 (0.8)24.4*Charges, mean (SE)\$690,244 (30,140)\$366,213 (15,234)\$324,031*Costs, mean (SE)\$218,425 (8,924)\$122,387 (4,341)\$96,038**p {$<$} 0.001},

  abstract = {Background The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide plus rituximab vs rituximab alone in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma. Methods A Markov decision model was established to carry out the cost-effectiveness analysis. Three discrete health states, progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death, were included. Cycle length was set at 1 month, and utility scores were derived from previously published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at \$29,306.43 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Both cost and effectiveness were determined using a 3\% annual discount rate. Furthermore, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to check the robustness of the model. Results Lenalidomide plus rituximab gained 6.08 QALYs at a cost of \$120,979.62 while rituximab alone gained 4.84 QALYs at a cost of \$48,052.11. The ICER of lenalidomide plus rituximab vs rituximab alone was \$58,812.51/QALY. The parameters most significantly influenced the model were the utility values for the PFS state, the duration of the PFS state in the lenalidomide plus rituximab group, and the cost of lenalidomide. The probability of lenalidomide plus rituximab or rituximab alone being the most cost-effective option was 0\% and 100\%, respectively, at a WTP threshold of \$29,306.43/QALY. Conclusions Lenalidomide plus rituximab is not a cost-effective strategy compared with rituximab monotherapy for relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma from a Chinese societal perspective.},

  abstract = {Purpose Monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended for long-term use after discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The present study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin after 12-month DAPT for patients with ACS who underwent PCI in China. Methods A 2-part model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel compared with aspirin. The short-term part was a decision tree that included health states such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, MI and stroke, cardiovascular death, and death from other causes with a treatment horizon of 1 year (base case), 2 years or 3 years after 12-month DAPT. Major bleeding was included. The long-term (lifetime) part was a Markov model that included different health states such as MI, after MI, stroke, after stroke, and death. Drug acquisition cost and other direct medical costs were based on pricing records, literature, and expert panels. Clinical outcomes and utilities were based on literature. The model output included incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs per patient. Both 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted. Findings In the base\textendash case scenario, the total costs of the treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin were \textyen 12,590 (\$1849/\texteuro 1590) and \textyen 10,642 (\$1563/\texteuro 1344), respectively; the total QALYs of the 2 patient populations were 9.7341 and 9.6894, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \textyen 43,593 (\$6402/\texteuro 5515) per QALY gained was lower than 3 times of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China (\textyen 161,940, \$23,786/\texteuro 20,449). Both 1-way sensitivity analysis and PSA confirmed the robustness of the results. PSA results indicated that clopidogrel was cost effective versus aspirin in 80.5\% of the simulations, considering {$>$}3 times the GDP per capita as the threshold. Results in other scenarios (clopidogrel or aspirin for 2 or 3 years after 12-month DAPT) also indicated that clopidogrel was more cost effective than aspirin for patients with ACS after 12-month DAPT. Implications Compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy for 1 year after 12-month DAPT was cost effective for patients with ACS who underwent PCI in China. Furthermore, when the duration of clopidogrel the monotherapy extended up to 3 years, clopidogrel was still cost effective compared with aspirin. The study was limited by lack of high-quality efficacy data among the Chinese population.},

  abstract = {Introduction Prostate cancer is considered one of the most important health problems. Due to the increased number of diagnosed patients and the inability to distinguish aggressive tumors, minimally-invasive procedures have become increasingly interesting. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an alternative option to radical surgery to treat prostate cancer. To date, however, data on side effects and comorbidities of this technique are still not conclusive. Methods and results We reviewed the literature to concentrate on side effects and comorbidities of HIFU treatment of prostate cancer with the following key words: hifu, high intensity focused ultrasound, ultrasonic therapy, transrectal hifu, prostate ablation, side effects, comorbidities. MedLine and Embase via Ovid database were searched. Selection criteria were: English language, articles published between 2001 and 2015, case series including at least 100 participants and reported data on side effects and comorbidities. Sixteen uncontrolled studies were identified. No randomized controlled trials (RCT) were found in the literature comparing side effects and comorbidities of HIFU to other routine approaches to prostate cancer treatment. Conclusion HIFU seems to be a promising minimally-invasive treatment for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, especially for patients who are unfit for radical surgery. Prospective studies with longer follow-up periods and RCT are required to properly assess the impact of side effects and comobidities related to the HIFU technique in comparison with other therapies to treat prostate cancer.},
