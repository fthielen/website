abstract: "**Introduction:** This article is part of the series “How to prepare a systematic review of economic evaluations (EES) for informing evidence-based healthcare decisions”, in which a five-step approach is proposed. **Areas covered:** This paper focuses on the selection of relevant databases and developing a search strategy for detecting EEs, as well as on how to perform the search and how to extract relevant data from retrieved records. **Expert commentary:** Thus far, little has been published on how to conduct systematic review EEs. Moreover, reliable sources of information, such as the Health Economic Evaluation Database, have ceased to publish updates. Researchers are thus left without authoritative guidance on how to conduct SR-EEs. Together with van Mastrigt et al. we seek to fill this gap."
